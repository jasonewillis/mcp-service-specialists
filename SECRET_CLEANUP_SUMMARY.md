# Secret Cleanup Summary

## ✅ Successfully Cleaned Repository

### What Was Done:
1. **Removed Stripe documentation files** containing test API keys from git history
2. **Updated .gitignore** to prevent future commits of sensitive files
3. **Force pushed** cleaned history to GitHub
4. **Cleaned git reflog** and performed garbage collection

### Files Removed:
- All files in `docs/external_services/platforms/stripe/` directory
- Total: 68 Stripe documentation files containing test API keys

### .gitignore Updated With:
```
# Stripe API Keys and Documentation
**/stripe/**/*.md
**/*stripe*.md
*_api_key*
*_secret*
sk_test_*
pk_test_*
docs/external_services/platforms/stripe/
```

### Repository Status:
- ✅ No secrets in commit history
- ✅ No secrets in current files (only references in code comments)
- ✅ Successfully pushed to GitHub
- ✅ Repository is clean and safe

### Next Steps:
1. **Rotate your Stripe test keys** in the Stripe Dashboard (even though they were test keys)
2. **Use environment variables** for all API keys going forward
3. **Never commit actual keys** - use placeholders like `sk_test_XXXXX` in documentation

### Important Notes:
- The removed files were Stripe documentation files that contained example test keys
- These were TEST keys (sk_test_*), not production keys
- The repository has been cleaned and is now safe to use
- The .gitignore will prevent similar issues in the future

## Verification Complete
The repository `mcp-service-specialists` is now clean and pushed to GitHub without any secrets.
