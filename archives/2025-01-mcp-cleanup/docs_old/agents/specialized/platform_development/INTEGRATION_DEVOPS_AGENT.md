## ðŸ§ª Testing & Validation

### Test Scenarios
```python
# Integration and DevOps testing scenarios
test_cases = [
    {
        "input": {
            "services": ["backend", "frontend", "postgres", "redis"],
            "deployment_target": "docker-compose",
            "security_requirements": {"tls_termination": True}
        },
        "expected_output": {
            "startup_time": "< 30 seconds",
            "service_connectivity": "100%",
            "security_compliance": ">= 95%"
        },
        "success_criteria": [
            "All services start successfully",
            "Inter-service communication works",
            "Security configurations applied"
        ]
    }
]
