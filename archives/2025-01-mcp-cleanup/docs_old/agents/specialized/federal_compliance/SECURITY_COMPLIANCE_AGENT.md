- **Testing Validation**: Compliance testing scenarios and validation procedures

### Task Routing Logic
```typescript
// When to use this agent
if (task.domain === "security" || 
    task.domain === "compliance" ||
    task.involves("nist") ||
    task.involves("accessibility") ||
    task.involves("section_508") ||
    task.involves("opencontrol")) {
    return await callMCPAgent("security-compliance", taskContext);
}

## ðŸ§ª Testing & Validation

### Test Scenarios
```python
# Security and compliance testing scenarios

    {
        "input": {
            "application_type": "web_application",
            "compliance_requirements": {"nist_800_53": ["AC", "AU"], "section_508": True}
        },
        "expected_output": {
            "compliance_score": ">= 85",
            "nist_controls_implemented": ">= 80%",
            "accessibility_score": ">= 95%"
        },
        "success_criteria": [
            "All critical security controls implemented",
            "Section 508 compliance achieved",
            "OpenControl documentation generated"
        ]
    }
