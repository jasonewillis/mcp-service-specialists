Advanced Networking Concepts:
  VLAN Implementation:
    Purpose: "Logical network segmentation for security and performance"
    Types: "Data VLANs, Voice VLANs, Management VLANs"
    Trunking: "802.1Q tagging for VLAN communication between switches"
    
    VLAN Configuration Example (Cisco):
      # Create VLANs
      vlan 10
       name SALES
      vlan 20
       name MARKETING
      vlan 30
       name IT
      
      # Configure access ports
      interface fastethernet 0/1
       switchport mode access
       switchport access vlan 10
       
      # Configure trunk port
      interface gigabitethernet 0/1
       switchport mode trunk
       switchport trunk allowed vlan 10,20,30
       
  Routing Protocols:
    OSPF (Open Shortest Path First):
      Type: "Link-state protocol"
      Metrics: "Cost based on bandwidth"
      Areas: "Hierarchical design with Area 0 as backbone"
      
      OSPF Configuration:
        router ospf 1
         network 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255 area 0
         network 10.0.0.0 0.0.0.3 area 0

      Standard ACLs: "Filter based on source IP only"
      Extended ACLs: "Filter based on source, destination, ports, protocols"
      
      Extended ACL Example:
        # Deny HTTP traffic from sales VLAN to servers
        access-list 101 deny tcp 192.168.10.0 0.0.0.255 192.168.100.0 0.0.0.255 eq 80
        # Permit all other traffic
        access-list 101 permit ip any any
        
        # Apply to interface
        interface fastethernet 0/1
         ip access-group 101 in
         
    Network Address Translation (NAT):
      Static NAT: "One-to-one mapping of private to public IP"
      Dynamic NAT: "Pool of public IPs mapped to private IPs"
      PAT (Port Address Translation): "Many private IPs to one public IP"
      
      NAT Configuration:
        # Define inside and outside interfaces
        interface fastethernet 0/0
         ip nat outside
        interface fastethernet 0/1
         ip nat inside
         
        # Configure PAT (overload)
        ip nat inside source list 1 interface fastethernet 0/0 overload
        access-list 1 permit 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255
```
