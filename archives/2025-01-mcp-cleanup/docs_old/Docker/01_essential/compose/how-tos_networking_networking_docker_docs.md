contentsUpdate containers on the networkLink containersMulti-host networkingSpecify custom networksConfigure the default networkUse an existing networkFurther reference information ImportantDocker's documentation refers to and describes Compose V2 functionality.Effective July 2023, Compose V1 stopped receiving updates and is no longer in new Docker Desktop releases. Compose V2 has replaced it and is now integrated into all current Docker Desktop versions. For more information, see Migrate to Compose V2.By default Compose sets up a single network for your app. Each container for a service joins the default network and is both reachable by other containers on that network, and discoverable by the service's name. NoteYour app's network is given a name based on the "project name", which is based on the name of the directory it lives in. You can override the project name with either the --project-name flag or the COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME environment variable.For example, suppose your app is in a directory called myapp, and your compose.yaml looks like this: services: web: build: . ports: - "8000:8000" db: image: postgres ports: - "8001:5432"When you run docker compose up, the following happens:A network called myapp_default is created.A container is created using web's configuration. It joins the network myapp_default under the name web.A container is created using db's configuration. It joins the network myapp_default under the name db.Each container can now look up the service name web or db and get back the appropriate container's IP address. For example, web's application code could connect to the URL postgres://db:5432 and start using the Postgres database.It is important to note the distinction between HOST_PORT and CONTAINER_PORT. In the above example, for db, the HOST_PORT is 8001 and the container port is 5432 (postgres default). Networked service-to-service communication uses the CONTAINER_PORT. When HOST_PORT is defined, the service is accessible outside the swarm as well.Within the web container, your connection string to db would look like postgres://db:5432, and from the host machine, the connection string would look like postgres://{DOCKER_IP}:8001 for example postgres://localhost:8001 if your container is running locally.Update containers on the networkIf you make a configuration change to a service and run docker compose up to update it, the old container is removed and the new one joins the network under a different IP address but the same name. Running containers can look up that name and connect to the new address, but the old address stops working.If any containers have connections open to the old container, they are closed. It is a container's responsibility to detect this condition, look up the name again and reconnect. TipReference containers by name, not IP, whenever possible. Otherwise you’ll need to constantly update the IP address you use.Link containersLinks allow you to define extra aliases by which a service is reachable from another service. They are not required to enable services to communicate. By default, any service can reach any other service at that service's name. In the following example, db is reachable from web at the hostnames db and database: services: web: build: . links: - "db:database" db: image: postgresSee the links reference for more information.Multi-host networkingWhen deploying a Compose application on a Docker Engine with Swarm mode enabled, you can make use of the built-in overlay driver to enable multi-host communication.Overlay networks are always created as attachable. You can optionally set the attachable property to false.Consult the Swarm mode section, to see how to set up a Swarm cluster, and the Getting started with multi-host networking to learn about multi-host overlay networks.Specify custom networksInstead of just using the default app network, you can specify your own networks with the top-level networks key. This lets you create more complex topologies and specify custom network drivers and options. You can also use it to connect services to externally-created networks which aren't managed by Compose.Each service can specify what networks to connect to with the service-level networks key, which is a list of names referencing entries under the top-level networks key.The following example shows a Compose file which defines two custom networks. The proxy service is isolated from the db service, because they do not share a network in common. Only app can talk to both. services: proxy: build: ./proxy networks: - frontend app: build: ./app networks: - frontend - backend db: image: postgres networks: - backend networks: frontend: # Specify driver options driver: bridge driver_opts: com.docker.network.bridge.host_binding_ipv4: "127.0.0.1" backend: # Use a custom driver driver: custom-driverNetworks can be configured with static IP addresses by setting the ipv4_address and/or ipv6_address for each attached network.Networks can also be given a custom name: services: # ... networks: frontend: name: custom_frontend driver: custom-driver-1Configure the default networkInstead of, or as well as, specifying your own networks, you can also change the settings of the app-wide default network by defining an entry under networks named default: services: web: build: . ports: - "8000:8000" db: image: postgres networks: default: # Use a custom driver driver: custom-driver-1Use an existing networkIf you've manually created a bridge network outside of Compose using the docker network create command, you can connect your Compose services to it by marking the network as external.If you want your containers to join a pre-existing network, use the external option services: # ... networks: network1: name: my-pre-existing-network external: trueInstead of attempting to create a network called [projectname]_default, Compose looks for a network called my-pre-existing-network and connects your app's containers to it.Further reference informationFor full details of the network configuration options available, see the following references:Top-level networks elementService-level networks attribute Edit this page Request changesTable of contentsUpdate containers on the networkLink containersMulti-host networkingSpecify custom networksConfigure the default networkUse an existing networkFurther reference information
