ClaudeTable of contentsHow to merge multiple Compose filesMerging rulesAdditional informationExampleLimitationsReference informationDocker Compose lets you merge and override a set of Compose files together to create a composite Compose file.By default, Compose reads two files, a compose.yaml and an optional compose.override.yaml file. By convention, the compose.yaml contains your base configuration. The override file can contain configuration overrides for existing services or entirely new services.If a service is defined in both files, Compose merges the configurations using the rules described below and in the Compose Specification.How to merge multiple Compose filesTo use multiple override files, or an override file with a different name, you can either use the pre-defined COMPOSE_FILE environment variable, or use the -f option to specify the list of files.Compose merges files in the order they're specified on the command line. Subsequent files may merge, override, or add to their predecessors.For example: $ docker compose -f compose.yaml -f compose.admin.yaml run backup_db The compose.yaml file might specify a webapp service. webapp: image: examples/web ports: - "8000:8000" volumes: - "/data"The compose.admin.yaml may also specify this same service: webapp: environment: - DEBUG=1Any matching fields override the previous file. New values, add to the webapp service configuration: webapp: image: examples/web ports: - "8000:8000" volumes: - "/data" environment: - DEBUG=1Merging rulesPaths are evaluated relative to the base file. When you use multiple Compose files, you must make sure all paths in the files are relative to the base Compose file (the first Compose file specified with -f). This is required because override files need not be valid Compose files. Override files can contain small fragments of configuration. Tracking which fragment of a service is relative to which path is difficult and confusing, so to keep paths easier to understand, all paths must be defined relative to the base file. TipYou can use docker compose config to review your merged configuration and avoid path-related issues.Compose copies configurations from the original service over to the local one. If a configuration option is defined in both the original service and the local service, the local value replaces or extends the original value.For single-value options like image, command or mem_limit, the new value replaces the old value.original service: services: myservice: # ... command: python app.pylocal service: services: myservice: # ... command: python otherapp.pyresult: services: myservice: # ... command: python otherapp.pyFor the multi-value options ports, expose, external_links, dns, dns_search, and tmpfs, Compose concatenates both sets of values:original service: services: myservice: # ... expose: - "3000"local service: services: myservice: # ... expose: - "4000" - "5000"result: services: myservice: # ... expose: - "3000" - "4000" - "5000"In the case of environment, labels, volumes, and devices, Compose "merges" entries together with locally defined values taking precedence. For environment and labels, the environment variable or label name determines which value is used:original service: services: myservice: # ... environment: - FOO=original - BAR=originallocal service: services: myservice: # ... environment: - BAR=local - BAZ=localresult: services: myservice: # ... environment: - FOO=original - BAR=local - BAZ=localEntries for volumes and devices are merged using the mount path in the container:original service: services: myservice: # ... volumes: - ./original:/foo - ./original:/barlocal service: services: myservice: # ... volumes: - ./local:/bar - ./local:/bazresult: services: myservice: # ... volumes: - ./original:/foo - ./local:/bar - ./local:/bazFor more merging rules, see Merge and override in the Compose Specification.Additional informationUsing -f is optional. If not provided, Compose searches the working directory and its parent directories for a compose.yaml and a compose.override.yaml file. You must supply at least the compose.yaml file. If both files exist on the same directory level, Compose combines them into a single configuration.You can use a -f with - (dash) as the filename to read the configuration from stdin. For example: $ docker compose -f - <<EOF webapp: image: examples/web ports: - "8000:8000" volumes: - "/data" environment: - DEBUG=1 EOF When stdin is used, all paths in the configuration are relative to the current working directory.You can use the -f flag to specify a path to a Compose file that is not located in the current directory, either from the command line or by setting up a COMPOSE_FILE environment variable in your shell or in an environment file.For example, if you are running the Compose Rails sample, and have a compose.yaml file in a directory called sandbox/rails. You can use a command like docker compose pull to get the postgres image for the db service from anywhere by using the -f flag as follows: docker compose -f ~/sandbox/rails/compose.yaml pull dbHere's the full example: $ docker compose -f ~/sandbox/rails/compose.yaml pull db Pulling db (postgres:latest)... latest: Pulling from library/postgres ef0380f84d05: Pull complete 50cf91dc1db8: Pull complete d3add4cd115c: Pull complete 467830d8a616: Pull complete 089b9db7dc57: Pull complete 6fba0a36935c: Pull complete 81ef0e73c953: Pull complete 338a6c4894dc: Pull complete 15853f32f67c: Pull complete 044c83d92898: Pull complete 17301519f133: Pull complete dcca70822752: Pull complete cecf11b8ccf3: Pull complete Digest: sha256:1364924c753d5ff7e2260cd34dc4ba05ebd40ee8193391220be0f9901d4e1651 Status: Downloaded newer image for postgres:latest ExampleA common use case for multiple files is changing a development Compose app for a production-like environment (which may be production, staging or CI). To support these differences, you can split your Compose configuration into a few different files:Start with a base file that defines the canonical configuration for the services.compose.yaml services: web: image: example/my_web_app:latest depends_on: - db - cache db: image: postgres:latest cache: image: redis:latestIn this example the development configuration exposes some ports to the host, mounts our code as a volume, and builds the web image.compose.override.yaml services: web: build: . volumes: - '.:/code' ports: - 8883:80 environment: DEBUG: 'true' db: command: '-d' ports: - 5432:5432 cache: ports: - 6379:6379When you run docker compose up it reads the overrides automatically.To use this Compose app in a production environment, another override file is created, which might be stored in a different git repository or managed by a different team.compose.prod.yaml services: web: ports: - 80:80 environment: PRODUCTION: 'true' cache: environment: TTL: '500'To deploy with this production Compose file you can run $ docker compose -f compose.yaml -f compose.prod.yaml up -d This deploys all three services using the configuration in compose.yaml and compose.prod.yaml but not the dev configuration in compose.override.yaml.For more information, see Using Compose in production.LimitationsDocker Compose supports relative paths for the many resources to be included in the application model: build context for service images, location of file defining environment variables, path to a local directory used in a bind-mounted volume. With such a constraint, code organization in a monorepo can become hard as a natural choice would be to have dedicated folders per team or component, but then the Compose files relative paths become irrelevant.Reference informationMerge rules Edit this page Request changesTable of contentsHow to merge multiple Compose filesMerging rulesAdditional informationExampleLimitationsReference information
