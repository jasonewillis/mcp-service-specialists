ClaudeOpen in ClaudeTable of contentsHow the extends attribute worksExtending services from another fileExtending services within the same fileExtending services within the same file and from another fileAdditional exampleRelative pathsReference informationDocker Compose's extends attribute lets you share common configurations among different files, or even different projects entirely.Extending services is useful if you have several services that reuse a common set of configuration options. With extends you can define a common set of service options in one place and refer to it from anywhere. You can refer to another Compose file and select a service you want to also use in your own application, with the ability to override some attributes for your own needs. ImportantWhen you use multiple Compose files, you must make sure all paths in the files are relative to the base Compose file (i.e. the Compose file in your main-project folder). This is required because extend files need not be valid Compose files. Extend files can contain small fragments of configuration. Tracking which fragment of a service is relative to which path is difficult and confusing, so to keep paths easier to understand, all paths must be defined relative to the base file.How the extends attribute worksExtending services from another fileTake the following example: services: web: extends: file: common-services.yml service: webappThis instructs Compose to re-use only the properties of the webapp service defined in the common-services.yml file. The webapp service itself is not part of the final project.If common-services.yml looks like this: services: webapp: build: . ports: - "8000:8000" volumes: - "/data"You get exactly the same result as if you wrote compose.yaml with the same build, ports, and volumes configuration values defined directly under web.To include the service webapp in the final project when extending services from another file, you need to explicitly include both services in your current Compose file. For example (this is for illustrative purposes only): services: web: build: alpine command: echo extends: file: common-services.yml service: webapp webapp: extends: file: common-services.yml service: webappAlternatively, you can use include.Extending services within the same fileIf you define services in the same Compose file and extend one service from another, both the original service and the extended service will be part of your final configuration. For example: services: web: build: alpine extends: webapp webapp: environment: - DEBUG=1Extending services within the same file and from another fileYou can go further and define, or re-define, configuration locally in compose.yaml: services: web: extends: file: common-services.yml service: webapp environment: - DEBUG=1 cpu_shares: 5 important_web: extends: web cpu_shares: 10Additional exampleExtending an individual service is useful when you have multiple services that have a common configuration. The example below is a Compose app with two services, a web application and a queue worker. Both services use the same codebase and share many configuration options.The common.yaml file defines the common configuration: services: app: build: . environment: CONFIG_FILE_PATH: /code/config API_KEY: xxxyyy cpu_shares: 5The compose.yaml defines the concrete services which use the common configuration: services: webapp: extends: file: common.yaml service: app command: /code/run_web_app ports: - 8080:8080 depends_on: - queue - db queue_worker: extends: file: common.yaml service: app command: /code/run_worker depends_on: - queueRelative pathsWhen using extends with a file attribute which points to another folder, relative paths declared by the service being extended are converted so they still point to the same file when used by the extending service. This is illustrated in the following example:Base Compose file: services: webapp: image: example extends: file: ../commons/compose.yaml service: baseThe commons/compose.yaml file: services: base: env_file: ./container.envThe resulting service refers to the original container.env file within the commons directory. This can be confirmed with docker compose config which inspects the actual model: services: webapp: image: example env_file: - ../commons/container.envReference informationextends Edit this page Request changesTable of contentsHow the extends attribute worksExtending services from another fileExtending services within the same fileExtending services within the same file and from another fileAdditional exampleRelative pathsReference information
