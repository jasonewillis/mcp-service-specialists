ClaudeTable of contentsAssigning profiles to servicesStart specific profilesStart multiple profilesAuto-starting profiles and dependency resolutionStop application and services with specific profilesReference informationProfiles help you adjust your Compose application for different environments or use cases by selectively activating services. Services can be assigned to one or more profiles; unassigned services start/stop by default, while assigned ones only start/stop when their profile is active. This setup means specific services, like those for debugging or development, to be included in a single compose.yml file and activated only as needed.Assigning profiles to servicesServices are associated with profiles through the profiles attribute which takes an array of profile names: services: frontend: image: frontend profiles: [frontend] phpmyadmin: image: phpmyadmin depends_on: [db] profiles: [debug] backend: image: backend db: image: mysqlHere the services frontend and phpmyadmin are assigned to the profiles frontend and debug respectively and as such are only started when their respective profiles are enabled.Services without a profiles attribute are always enabled. In this case running docker compose up would only start backend and db.Valid profiles names follow the regex format of [a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9_.-]+. TipThe core services of your application shouldn't be assigned profiles so they are always enabled and automatically started.Start specific profilesTo start a specific profile supply the --profile command-line option or use the COMPOSE_PROFILES environment variable: $ docker compose --profile debug up $ COMPOSE_PROFILES=debug docker compose up Both commands start the services with the debug profile enabled. In the previous compose.yaml file, this starts the services db, backend and phpmyadmin.Start multiple profilesYou can also enable multiple profiles, e.g. with docker compose --profile frontend --profile debug up the profiles frontend and debug will be enabled.Multiple profiles can be specified by passing multiple --profile flags or a comma-separated list for the COMPOSE_PROFILES environment variable: $ docker compose --profile frontend --profile debug up $ COMPOSE_PROFILES=frontend,debug docker compose up If you want to enable all profiles at the same time, you can run docker compose --profile "*".Auto-starting profiles and dependency resolutionWhen you explicitly target a service on the command line that has one or more profiles assigned, you do not need to enable the profile manually as Compose runs that service regardless of whether its profile is activated. This is useful for running one-off services or debugging tools.Only the targeted service (and any of its declared dependencies via depends_on) is started. Other services that share the same profile will not be started unless:They are also explicitly targeted, orThe profile is explicitly enabled using --profile or COMPOSE_PROFILES.When a service with assigned profiles is explicitly targeted on the command line its profiles are started automatically so you don't need to start them manually. This can be used for one-off services and debugging tools. As an example consider the following configuration: services: backend: image: backend db: image: mysql db-migrations: image: backend command: myapp migrate depends_on: - db profiles: - tools # Only start backend and db (no profiles involved) $ docker compose up -d # Run the db-migrations service without manually enabling the 'tools' profile $ docker compose run db-migrationsIn this example, db-migrations runs even though it is assigned to the tools profile, because it was explicitly targeted. The db service is also started automatically because it is listed in depends_on.If the targeted service has dependencies that are also gated behind a profile, you must ensure those dependencies are either:In the same profileStarted separatelyNot assigned to any profile so are always enabledStop application and services with specific profilesAs with starting specific profiles, you can use the --profile command-line option or use the COMPOSE_PROFILES environment variable: $ docker compose --profile debug down $ COMPOSE_PROFILES=debug docker compose down Both commands stop and remove services with the debug profile and services without a profile. In the following compose.yaml file, this stops the services db, backend and phpmyadmin. services: frontend: image: frontend profiles: [frontend] phpmyadmin: image: phpmyadmin depends_on: [db] profiles: [debug] backend: image: backend db: image: mysqlif you only want to stop the phpmyadmin service, you can run $ docker compose down phpmyadmin or $ docker compose stop phpmyadmin NoteRunning docker compose down only stops backend and db.Reference informationprofiles Edit this page Request changesTable of contentsAssigning profiles to servicesStart specific profilesStart multiple profilesAuto-starting profiles and dependency resolutionStop application and services with specific profilesReference information
