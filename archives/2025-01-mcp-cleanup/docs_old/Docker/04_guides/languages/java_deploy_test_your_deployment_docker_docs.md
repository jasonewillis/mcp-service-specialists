This lets you test and debug your workloads on Kubernetes locally before deploying.Create a Kubernetes YAML fileIn your spring-petclinic directory, create a file named docker-java-kubernetes.yaml. Open the file in an IDE or text editor and add the following contents. Replace DOCKER_USERNAME/REPO_NAME with your Docker username and the name of the repository that you created in Configure CI/CD for your Java application. apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment metadata: name: docker-java-demo namespace: default spec: replicas: 1 selector: matchLabels: service: server template: metadata: labels: service: server spec: containers: - name: server-service image: DOCKER_USERNAME/REPO_NAME imagePullPolicy: Always --- apiVersion: v1 kind: Service metadata: name: service-entrypoint namespace: default spec: type: NodePort selector: service: server ports: - port: 8080 targetPort: 8080 nodePort: 30001In this Kubernetes YAML file, there are two objects, separated by the ---:A Deployment, describing a scalable group of identical pods. In this case, you'll get just one replica, or copy of your pod. That pod, which is described under template, has just one container in it. The container is created from the image built by GitHub Actions in Configure CI/CD for your Java application.A NodePort service, which will route traffic from port 30001 on your host to port 8080 inside the pods it routes to, allowing you to reach your app from the network.To learn more about Kubernetes objects, see the Kubernetes documentation.Deploy and check your applicationIn a terminal, navigate to spring-petclinic and deploy your application to Kubernetes. $ kubectl apply -f docker-java-kubernetes.yaml You should see output that looks like the following, indicating your Kubernetes objects were created successfully. deployment.apps/docker-java-demo created service/service-entrypoint createdMake sure everything worked by listing your deployments. $ kubectl get deployments Your deployment should be listed as follows: NAME READY UP-TO-DATE AVAILABLE AGE docker-java-demo 1/1 1 1 15sThis indicates all one of the pods you asked for in your YAML are up and running. Do the same check for your services. $ kubectl get services You should get output like the following. NAME TYPE CLUSTER-IP EXTERNAL-IP PORT(S) AGE kubernetes ClusterIP 10.96.0.1 <none> 443/TCP 23h service-entrypoint NodePort 10.99.128.230 <none> 8080:30001/TCP 75sIn addition to the default kubernetes service, you can see your service-entrypoint service, accepting traffic on port 30001/TCP.In a terminal, curl the service. Note that a database wasn't deployed in this example. $ curl --request GET \ --url http://localhost:30001/actuator/health \ --header 'content-type: application/json' You should get output like the following. {"status":"UP","groups":["liveness","readiness"]} Run the following command to tear down your application. $ kubectl delete -f docker-java-kubernetes.yaml SummaryIn this section, you learned how to use Docker Desktop to deploy your application to a fully-featured Kubernetes environment on your development machine.Related information:Kubernetes documentationDeploy on Kubernetes with Docker DesktopSwarm mode overview Edit this page Request changesTable of contentsPrerequisitesOverviewCreate a Kubernetes YAML fileDeploy and check your applicationSummary
