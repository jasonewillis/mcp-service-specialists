This includes:Linting and formatting with RuffStatic type checking with PyrightAutomating checks with pre-commit hooksLinting and formatting with RuffRuff is an extremely fast Python linter and formatter written in Rust. It replaces multiple tools like flake8, isort, and black with a single unified tool.Create a pyproject.toml file: [tool.ruff] target-version = "py312" [tool.ruff.lint] select = [ "E", # pycodestyle errors "W", # pycodestyle warnings "F", # pyflakes "I", # isort "B", # flake8-bugbear "C4", # flake8-comprehensions "UP", # pyupgrade "ARG001", # unused arguments in functions ] ignore = [ "E501", # line too long, handled by black "B008", # do not perform function calls in argument defaults "W191", # indentation contains tabs "B904", # Allow raising exceptions without from e, for HTTPException ]Using RuffRun these commands to check and format your code: # Check for errors ruff check . # Automatically fix fixable errors ruff check --fix . # Format code ruff format .Type checking with PyrightPyright is a fast static type checker for Python that works well with modern Python features.Add Pyright configuration in pyproject.toml: [tool.pyright] typeCheckingMode = "strict" pythonVersion = "3.12" exclude = [".venv"]Running PyrightTo check your code for type errors: pyrightSetting up pre-commit hooksPre-commit hooks automatically run checks before each commit. The following .pre-commit-config.yaml snippet sets up Ruff: https: https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff-pre-commit rev: v0.2.2 hooks: - id: ruff args: [--fix] - id: ruff-formatTo install and use: pre-commit install git commit -m "Test commit" # Automatically runs checksSummaryIn this section, you learned how to:Configure and use Ruff for linting and formattingSet up Pyright for static type checkingAutomate checks with pre-commit hooksThese tools help maintain code quality and catch errors early in development.Next stepsConfigure GitHub Actions to run these checks automaticallyCustomize linting rules to match your team's style preferencesExplore advanced type checking features Edit this page Request changesTable of contentsPrerequisitesOverviewLinting and formatting with RuffUsing RuffType checking with PyrightRunning PyrightSetting up pre-commit hooksSummaryNext stepsAutomate your builds with GitHub Actions »
