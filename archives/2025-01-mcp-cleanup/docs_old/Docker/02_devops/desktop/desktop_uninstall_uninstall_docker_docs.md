Docker Desktop destroys Docker containers, images, volumes, and other Docker-related data local to the machine, and removes the files generated by the application. To learn how to preserve important data before uninstalling, refer to the back up and restore data section. Windows Mac Ubuntu Debian Fedora ArchFrom the GUIFrom the Windows Start menu, select Settings > Apps > Apps & features.Select Docker Desktop from the Apps & features list and then select Uninstall.Select Uninstall to confirm your selection.From the CLILocate the installer: $ C:\Program Files\Docker\Docker\Docker Desktop Installer.exe Uninstall Docker Desktop.In PowerShell, run: $ Start-Process 'Docker Desktop Installer.exe' -Wait uninstall In the Command Prompt, run: $ start /w "" "Docker Desktop Installer.exe" uninstall After uninstalling Docker Desktop, some residual files may remain which you can remove manually. These are: C:\ProgramData\Docker C:\ProgramData\DockerDesktop C:\Program Files\Docker C:\Users\<your user name>\AppData\Local\Docker C:\Users\<your user name>\AppData\Roaming\Docker C:\Users\<your user name>\AppData\Roaming\Docker Desktop C:\Users\<your user name>\.docker From the GUIOpen Docker Desktop.In the top-right corner of the Docker Desktop Dashboard, select the Troubleshoot icon.Select Uninstall.When prompted, confirm by selecting Uninstall again.You can then move the Docker application to the trash.From the CLIRun: $ /Applications/Docker.app/Contents/MacOS/uninstall You can then move the Docker application to the trash. NoteYou may encounter the following error when uninstalling Docker Desktop using the uninstall command. $ /Applications/Docker.app/Contents/MacOS/uninstall Password: Uninstalling Docker Desktop... Error: unlinkat /Users/<USER_HOME>/Library/Containers/com.docker.docker/.com.apple.containermanagerd.metadata.plist: > operation not permitted The operation not permitted error is reported either on the file .com.apple.containermanagerd.metadata.plist or on the parent directory /Users/<USER_HOME>/Library/Containers/com.docker.docker/. This error can be ignored as you have successfully uninstalled Docker Desktop. You can remove the directory /Users/<USER_HOME>/Library/Containers/com.docker.docker/ later by allowing Full Disk Access to the terminal application you are using (System Settings > Privacy & Security > Full Disk Access).After uninstalling Docker Desktop, some residual files may remain which you can remove: $ rm -rf ~/Library/Group\ Containers/group.com.docker $ rm -rf ~/.docker With Docker Desktop version 4.36 and earlier, the following files may also be left on the file system. You can remove these with administrative privileges: /Library/PrivilegedHelperTools/com.docker.vmnetd /Library/PrivilegedHelperTools/com.docker.socket To uninstall Docker Desktop for Ubuntu:Remove the Docker Desktop application. Run: $ sudo apt remove docker-desktop This removes the Docker Desktop package itself but doesn’t delete all of its files or settings.Manually remove leftover file. $ rm -r $HOME/.docker/desktop $ sudo rm /usr/local/bin/com.docker.cli $ sudo apt purge docker-desktop This removes configuration and data files at $HOME/.docker/desktop, the symlink at /usr/local/bin/com.docker.cli, and purges the remaining systemd service files.Clean up Docker config settings. In $HOME/.docker/config.json, remove the credsStore and currentContext properties.These entries tell Docker where to store credentials and which context is active. If they remain after uninstalling Docker Desktop, they may conflict with a future Docker setup.To uninstall Docker Desktop for Debian, run:Remove the Docker Desktop application: $ sudo apt remove docker-desktop This removes the Docker Desktop package itself but doesn’t delete all of its files or settings.Manually remove leftover file. $ rm -r $HOME/.docker/desktop $ sudo rm /usr/local/bin/com.docker.cli $ sudo apt purge docker-desktop This removes configuration and data files at $HOME/.docker/desktop, the symlink at /usr/local/bin/com.docker.cli, and purges the remaining systemd service files.Clean up Docker config settings.
