ClaudeOpen in ClaudeTable of contentsTroubleshoot menuDiagnoseCheck the logsView the Docker daemon logsFurther resourcesThis page contains information on how to diagnose and troubleshoot Docker Desktop, and how to check the logs. WarningIf you're experiencing malware detection issues on Mac, follow the steps documented in docker/for-mac#7527.Troubleshoot menuTo navigate to Troubleshoot either:Select the Docker menu Docker menu and then Troubleshoot.Select the Troubleshoot icon near the top-right corner of Docker Dashboard.The Troubleshooting menu contains the following options:Restart Docker Desktop.Reset Kubernetes cluster. Select to delete all stacks and Kubernetes resources. For more information, see Kubernetes.Clean / Purge data. This option resets all Docker data without a reset to factory defaults. Selecting this option results in the loss of existing settings.Reset to factory defaults: Choose this option to reset all options on Docker Desktop to their initial state, the same as when Docker Desktop was first installed.If you are a Mac or Linux user, you also have the option to Uninstall Docker Desktop from your system.Diagnose TipIf you do not find a solution in troubleshooting, browse the GitHub repositories or create a new issue:docker/for-macdocker/for-windocker/for-linuxDiagnose from the appFrom Troubleshoot, select Get support. This opens the in-app Support page and starts collecting the diagnostics.When the diagnostics collection process is complete, select Upload to get a Diagnostic ID.When the diagnostics are uploaded, Docker Desktop prints a diagnostic ID. Copy this ID.Use your diagnostics ID to get help:If you have a paid Docker subscription, select Contact support. This opens the Docker Desktop support form. Fill in the information required and add the ID you copied in step three to the Diagnostics ID field. Then, select Submit ticket to request Docker Desktop support. NoteYou must be signed in to Docker Desktop to access the support form. For information on what's covered as part of Docker Desktop support, see Support.If you don't have a paid Docker subscription, select Report a Bug to open a new Docker Desktop issue on GitHub. Complete the information required and ensure you add the diagnostic ID you copied in step three.Diagnose from an error messageWhen an error message appears, select Gather diagnostics.When the diagnostics are uploaded, Docker Desktop prints a diagnostic ID. Copy this ID.Use your diagnostics ID to get help:If you have a paid Docker subscription, select Contact support. This opens the Docker Desktop support form. Fill in the information required and add the ID you copied in step three to the Diagnostics ID field. Then, select Submit ticket to request Docker Desktop support. NoteYou must be signed in to Docker Desktop to access the support form. For information on what's covered as part of Docker Desktop support, see Support.If you don't have a paid Docker subscription, you can open a new Docker Desktop issue on GitHub for Mac, Windows, or Linux. Complete the information required and ensure you add the diagnostic ID printed in step two.Diagnose from the terminalIn some cases, it's useful to run the diagnostics yourself, for instance, if Docker Desktop cannot start. Windows Mac LinuxLocate the com.docker.diagnose tool: $ C:\Program Files\Docker\Docker\resources\com.docker.diagnose.exe Create and upload the diagnostics ID. In PowerShell, run: $ & "C:\Program Files\Docker\Docker\resources\com.docker.diagnose.exe" gather -upload After the diagnostics have finished, the terminal displays your diagnostics ID and the path to the diagnostics file. The diagnostics ID is composed of your user ID and a timestamp. For example BE9AFAAF-F68B-41D0-9D12-84760E6B8740/20190905152051.Locate the com.docker.diagnose tool: $ /Applications/Docker.app/Contents/MacOS/com.docker.diagnose Create and upload the diagnostics ID. Run: $ /Applications/Docker.app/Contents/MacOS/com.docker.diagnose gather -upload After the diagnostics have finished, the terminal displays your diagnostics ID and the path to the diagnostics file. The diagnostics ID is composed of your user ID and a timestamp. For example BE9AFAAF-F68B-41D0-9D12-84760E6B8740/20190905152051.Locate the com.docker.diagnose tool: $ /opt/docker-desktop/bin/com.docker.diagnose Create and upload the diagnostics ID. Run: $ /opt/docker-desktop/bin/com.docker.diagnose gather -upload After the diagnostics have finished, the terminal displays your diagnostics ID and the path to the diagnostics file. The diagnostics ID is composed of your user ID and a timestamp. For example BE9AFAAF-F68B-41D0-9D12-84760E6B8740/20190905152051.To view the contents of the diagnostic file: Windows Mac LinuxUnzip the file. In PowerShell, copy and paste the path to the diagnostics file into the following command and then run it. It should be similar to the following example: $ Expand-Archive -LiteralPath "C:\Users\testUser\AppData\Local\Temp\5DE9978A-3848-429E-8776-950FC869186F\20230607101602.zip" -DestinationPath "C:\Users\testuser\AppData\Local\Temp\5DE9978A-3848-429E-8776-950FC869186F\20230607101602"Open the file in your preferred text editor. Run: $ code <path-to-file>Run: $ open /tmp/<your-diagnostics-ID>.zip Run: $ unzip –l /tmp/<your-diagnostics-ID>.zip Use your diagnostics ID to get helpIf you have a paid Docker subscription, select Contact support. This opens the Docker Desktop support form. Fill in the information required and add the ID you copied in step three to the Diagnostics ID field. Then, select Submit ticket to request Docker Desktop support.If you don't have a paid Docker subscription, create an issue on GitHub:For LinuxFor MacFor WindowsSelf-diagnose tool ImportantThis tool has been deprecated.Check the logsIn addition to using the diagnose option to submit logs, you can browse the logs yourself. Windows Mac LinuxIn PowerShell, run: $ code $Env:LOCALAPPDATA\Docker\logThis opens up all the logs in your preferred text editor for you to explore.From terminalTo watch the live flow of Docker Desktop logs in the command line, run the following script from your preferred shell. $ pred='process matches ".*(ocker|vpnkit).*" || (process in {"taskgated-helper", "launchservicesd", "kernel"} && eventMessage contains[c] "docker")' $ /usr/bin/log stream --style syslog --level=debug --color=always --predicate "$pred" Alternatively, to collect the last day of logs (1d) in a file, run: $ /usr/bin/log show --debug --info --style syslog --last 1d --predicate "$pred" >/tmp/logs.txt From the Console appMac provides a built-in log viewer, named Console, which you can use to check Docker logs.The Console lives in /Applications/Utilities. You can search for it with Spotlight Search.To read the Docker app log messages, type docker in the Console window search bar and press Enter. Then select ANY to expand the drop-down list next to your docker search entry, and select Process. You can use the Console Log Query to search logs, filter the results in various ways, and create reports.You can access Docker Desktop logs by running the following command: $ journalctl --user --unit=docker-desktop You can also find the logs for the internal components included in Docker Desktop at $HOME/.docker/desktop/log/.View the Docker daemon logsRefer to the Read the daemon logs section to learn how to view the Docker Daemon logs.Further resourcesView specific troubleshoot topics.View information on known issues Edit this page Request changesTable of contentsTroubleshoot menuDiagnoseCheck the logsView the Docker daemon logsFurther resources Troubleshooting
