contentsPrerequisitesUse Docker Build Cloud without Docker DesktopStepsFirewall configurationWhat's nextBefore you can start using Docker Build Cloud, you must add the builder to your local environment.PrerequisitesTo get started with Docker Build Cloud, you need to:Download and install Docker Desktop version 4.26.0 or later.Create a cloud builder on the Docker Build Cloud Dashboard.When you create the builder, choose a name for it (for example, default). You will use this name as BUILDER_NAME in the CLI steps below.Use Docker Build Cloud without Docker DesktopTo use Docker Build Cloud without Docker Desktop, you must download and install a version of Buildx with support for Docker Build Cloud (the cloud driver). You can find compatible Buildx binaries on the releases page of this repository.If you plan on building with Docker Build Cloud using the docker compose build command, you also need a version of Docker Compose that supports Docker Build Cloud. You can find compatible Docker Compose binaries on the releases page of this repository.StepsYou can add a cloud builder using the CLI, with the docker buildx create command, or using the Docker Desktop settings GUI. CLI Docker DesktopSign in to your Docker account. $ docker login Add the cloud builder endpoint. $ docker buildx create --driver cloud <ORG>/<BUILDER_NAME> Replace <ORG> with the Docker Hub namespace of your Docker organization (or your username if you are using a personal account), and <BUILDER_NAME> with the name you chose when creating the builder in the dashboard.This creates a local instance of the cloud builder named cloud-ORG-BUILDER_NAME. NoteIf your organization is acme and you named your builder default, use: $ docker buildx create --driver cloud acme/default Sign in to your Docker account using the Sign in button in Docker Desktop.Open the Docker Desktop settings and navigate to the Builders tab.Under Available builders, select Connect to builder.The builder has native support for the linux/amd64 and linux/arm64 architectures. This gives you a high-performance build cluster for building multi-platform images natively.Firewall configurationTo use Docker Build Cloud behind a firewall, ensure that your firewall allows traffic to the following addresses:3.211.38.21https://auth.docker.iohttps://build-cloud.docker.comhttps://hub.docker.comWhat's nextSee Building with Docker Build Cloud for examples on how to use Docker Build Cloud.See Use Docker Build Cloud in CI for examples on how to use Docker Build Cloud with CI systems.
