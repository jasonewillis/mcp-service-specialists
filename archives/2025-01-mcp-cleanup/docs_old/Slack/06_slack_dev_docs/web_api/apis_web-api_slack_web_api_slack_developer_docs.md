# Slack Web API | Slack Developer Docs

APIsWeb APIOn this pageSlack Web API The Slack Web API is an interface for querying information from and enacting change in a Slack workspace. Use it for individual queries, or as part of a more complex tapestry of platform features in a Slack app. Web API methods Basic overview​ The Web API is a collection of HTTP RPC-style methods, all with URLs in the form https://slack.com/api/METHOD_FAMILY.method. While it's not a REST API, those familiar with REST should be at home with its foundations in HTTP. Use HTTPS, SSL, and TLS v1.2 or above when calling all methods. Learn more about our SSL and TLS requirements. Each method has a series of arguments informing the execution of your intentions. Pass arguments as: GET querystring parameters, POST parameters presented as application/x-www-form-urlencoded, or a mix of both GET and POST parameters Most write methods allow arguments with application/json attributes. Some methods, such as chat.postMessage and dialog.open, feature arguments that accept an associative JSON array. However, these methods can be difficult to properly construct when using a application/x-www-form-urlencoded Content-type, so we strongly recommend using JSON-encoded bodies instead. POST bodies​ When sending a HTTP POST, you may present your arguments as either standard POST parameters, or you may use JSON instead. URL-encoded bodies​ When sending URL-encoded data, set your HTTP Content-type header to application/x-www-form-urlencoded and present your key/value pairs according to RFC-3986. For example, a POST request to the conversations.create method might look something like this: POST /api/conversations.createContent-type: application/x-www-form-urlencodedtoken=xoxp-xxxxxxxxx-xxxx&name=something-urgent JSON-encoded bodies​ For write methods that support JSON, you may alternatively send your HTTP POST data as Content-type: application/json. There are some ground rules: You must explicitly set the Content-type HTTP header to application/json. We won't interpret your POST body as such without it. You must transmit your token as a bearer token in the Authorization HTTP header. You cannot send your token as part of the query string or as an attribute in your posted JSON. Do not mix arguments between query string, URL-encoded POST body, and JSON attributes. Choose one approach per request. Providing an explicitly null value for an attribute will result in whichever default behavior is assigned to it. For example, to send the same request above to the conversations.create method with a JSON POST body, send something like this: POST /api/conversations.createContent-type: application/jsonAuthorization: Bearer xoxp-xxxxxxxxx-xxxx{"name":"something-urgent"} Note how we present the token with the string Bearer pre-pended to it, indicating the OAuth 2.0 authentication scheme. Consult your favorite HTTP tool or library's manual for further detail on setting HTTP headers. Here's a more complicated example — posting a message with menus using chat.postMessage: POST /api/chat.postMessageContent-type: application/jsonAuthorization: Bearer xoxp-xxxxxxxxx-xxxx{"channel":"C123ABC456","text":"I hope the tour went well, Mr. Wonka.","attachments":[{"text":"Who wins the lifetime supply of chocolate?","fallback":"You could be telling the computer exactly what it can do with a lifetime supply of chocolate.","color":"#3AA3E3","attachment_type":"default","callback_id":"select_simple_1234","actions":[{"name":"winners_list","text":"Who should win?","type":"select","data_source":"users"}]}]} The attachments argument is sent a straightforward JSON array. Here's how to do that with cURL: curl -X POST -H 'Authorization: Bearer xoxb-1234-56789abcdefghijklmnop' \-H 'Content-type: application/json' \--data '{"channel":"C123ABC456","text":"I hope the tour went well, Mr. Wonka.","attachments": [{"text":"Who wins the lifetime supply of chocolate?","fallback":"You could be telling the computer exactly what it can do with a lifetime supply of chocolate.","color":"#3AA3E3","attachment_type":"default","callback_id":"select_simple_1234","actions":[{"name":"winners_list","text":"Who should win?","type":"select","data_source":"users"}]}]}' \https://slack.com/api/chat.postMessage< Errors specific to passing JSON​ If the posted JSON is invalid, you'll receive one of the following errors in response: invalid_json: The JSON you've included in your POST body cannot be parsed. This might be because it's actually not JSON, or perhaps you did not correctly set your HTTP Content-type header. Ensure your JSON attribute keys are strings wrapped with double-quote (") characters. json_not_object: We could understand that your code was JSON-like enough to parse it, but it's not actually a JSON hash of attribute key/value pairs. Perhaps you sent us an array, or just a string or a number. In both cases, you'll need to revise your JSON or how you're transmitting your data to resolve the error condition. Evaluating responses​ All Web API responses contain a JSON object, which will always contain a top-level boolean property ok that indicates success or failure. For failure results, the error property will contain a short machine-readable error code. In the case of problematic calls that could still be completed successfully, ok will be true and the warning property will contain a short machine-readable warning code (or comma-separated list of them, in the case of multiple warnings). See the following examples: { "ok": true, "stuff": "This is good"} { "ok": false, "error": "something_bad"} { "ok": true, "warning": "something_problematic", "stuff": "Your requested information"} Other properties are defined in the documentation for each relevant method. There's a lot of "stuff" to unpack, including these types and other method or domain-specific curiosities. Authentication​ Authenticate your Web API requests by providing a bearer token, which identifies a single user or bot user relationship. Register your application with Slack to obtain credentials for use with our OAuth 2.0 implementation, which allows you to negotiate tokens on behalf of users and workspaces. We prefer tokens to be sent in the Authorization HTTP header of your outbound requests. However, you may also pass tokens in all Web API calls as a POST body parameter called token. Tokens cannot be sent as a query parameter. Treat tokens with careNever share tokens with other users or applications. Do not publish tokens in public code repositories. Review token safety tips. HTTPS, SSL, and TLS​ Slack requires HTTPS, SSL, and TLS v1.2 or above. The platform and the Web API are governed by the same rules. Learn more about our deprecation of early TLS versions. Stay safe and secure. All TLS connections must use the SNI extension. Lastly, TLS connections must support at least one of the following cipher suites: TLS 1.2: ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256 ECDHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305 ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384 TLS 1.3: TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256 Methods​ With over 200 methods, surely there's one right for you.
