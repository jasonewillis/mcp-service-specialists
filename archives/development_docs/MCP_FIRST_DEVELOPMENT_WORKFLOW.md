## 🎯 Workflow Overview

**Core Principle**: 80% MCP Research / 20% Implementation Split

This system transforms how Claude Code approaches fedJobAdvisor development by leveraging specialized MCP agents for comprehensive research before any implementation begins.

### The MCP-First Advantage
- **Specialized Expertise**: 10 domain-specific agents with deep technical mastery
- **NO BS Compliance**: Quantitative claims backed by data, honest limitation acknowledgment
- **Systematic Research**: Comprehensive documentation before implementation
- **Quality Gates**: Multiple validation checkpoints ensuring reality alignment

## 🔧 Core Components (All Implemented ✅)

### 1. Task Router (`mcp_task_router.py`)
**Purpose**: Intelligent routing of development tasks to appropriate MCP agents

**Key Features**:
- Task classification using pattern matching
- Agent selection matrix for optimal research coverage
- Complexity assessment (1-10 scale)
- Risk factor identification
- Compliance requirements detection
- Effort estimation for realistic planning

**Example Usage**:
```python
from mcp_task_router import MCPTaskRouter

router = MCPTaskRouter()
analysis = router.analyze_task("Add Stripe payment integration with subscription management")

# Results:
# Type: payment_integration
# Primary Agents: data_scientist, database_admin
# Complexity: 9/10
# Estimated Effort: Large (1 week)
```

### 2. MCP Research Caller (`mcp_research_caller.py`)
**Purpose**: Interface for Claude Code to request systematic research from MCP agents

**4-Phase Workflow**:
1. **Context Gathering**: Current state analysis and constraint identification
2. **MCP Research Assignment**: 80% of thinking done by specialized agents
3. **Research Validation**: NO BS compliance and reality checking
4. **Implementation Planning**: Step-by-step instructions for general agents

**File Management**:
- `active/` - Research in progress
- `completed/` - Research ready for implementation  
- `_archived/` - Historical research for reference

### 3. Technical Mastery Documentation (10 Agents)
**Purpose**: Deep domain expertise knowledge bases for each MCP agent

**Completed Agents**:
- **Data Scientist**: ML/AI, statistical analysis, feature engineering
- **Statistician**: Mathematical methods, hypothesis testing, experimental design
- **Database Admin**: PostgreSQL optimization, query tuning, data architecture
- **DevOps Engineer**: CI/CD, containerization, infrastructure automation

## 🚀 How Claude Code Uses This System

### For Any Development Task, Claude Code Now:

#### Step 1: Task Analysis
```python
# Claude Code analyzes the user's request
task_description = "Add Stripe payment integration with subscription management"
router = MCPTaskRouter()
analysis = router.analyze_task(task_description)
```

#### Step 2: MCP Research Request
```python
# Claude Code requests comprehensive research
caller = MCPResearchCaller()
research_result = await caller.request_research(
    task_name="stripe_payment_integration",
    task_description=task_description,
    task_type=analysis.task_type.value,
    priority="high"
)
```

#### Step 3: Follow MCP Guidance
Claude Code reads the generated research files:
- Context analysis with constraints
- Comprehensive agent research with technical recommendations
- Validation results with NO BS compliance
- Step-by-step implementation plan

#### Step 4: Implement Following Research
Claude Code executes the implementation plan created by MCP agents, ensuring alignment with research recommendations.
