**Federal Employee COL Dashboard - Data Science Perspective**

**Essential Metrics to Track:**
1. **Locality Pay Adjustments** (OPM data)
   - Real-time locality pay percentages
   - Historical trends (5-year analysis)
   - Predictive modeling for future adjustments

2. **Cost Index Comparisons**
   - Housing costs (30-40% of budget)
   - Transportation costs (15-20% of budget)
   - Healthcare costs with FEHB adjustments
   - State/local tax implications

3. **Net Salary Calculator**
   - Gross salary by grade/step
   - Locality pay adjustment
   - Tax withholdings by state
   - TSP contributions impact
   - Final take-home comparison

**Visualization Recommendations:**
1. **Interactive Map Dashboard**
   - Choropleth map with locality zones
   - Click-to-compare functionality
   - Heat maps for cost categories

2. **Side-by-Side Comparators**
   - Current location vs target location
   - Parallel coordinates for multi-city comparison
   - Waterfall charts for salary breakdown

3. **Time Series Analysis**
   - 5-year trend lines for each locality
   - Seasonal adjustment patterns
   - Inflation-adjusted projections

**Data Science Techniques:**
- **Clustering**: Group similar cost-of-living cities
- **Regression**: Predict future locality adjustments
- **Optimization**: Find best value locations for grade level
- **Anomaly Detection**: Flag unusual cost spikes

**Key Performance Indicators:**
- Decision confidence score (0-100)
- Break-even timeline for moves
- Quality of life index normalized
- Career advancement opportunity score

**Implementation Priority:**
1. Basic salary calculator (Week 1)
2. Location comparison tool (Week 2)
3. Predictive analytics (Week 3)
4. Advanced visualizations (Week 4)
