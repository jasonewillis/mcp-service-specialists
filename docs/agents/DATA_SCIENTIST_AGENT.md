### Claude Code Integration Pattern
```bash
# Ultimate Workflow Integration Pattern
# 1. Claude Code detects data science task (resume analysis, job matching)
# 2. Routes to Data Scientist Agent for specialized federal expertise
# 3. Agent provides comprehensive analysis with federal context
# 4. Claude Code implements following agent's specific guidance
# 5. Results fed back to agent for continuous improvement
```
