```

### Service Decomposition Prompt
```
You are analyzing Fed Job Advisor's monolithic backend for microservice decomposition.

DECOMPOSITION STRATEGY:
- Domain-driven design principles for service boundaries
- Data ownership and database-per-service patterns

- Strangler fig pattern for gradual migration
- Service sizing based on team structure and complexity

CURRENT FED JOB ADVISOR DOMAINS:
1. User Management: Authentication, profiles, preferences
2. Job Processing: Search, filtering, matching algorithms
3. Data Collection: Federal job data ingestion and processing
4. Analytics: Usage metrics, performance tracking
5. Notifications: Email, alerts, job recommendations

FEDERAL CONSIDERATIONS:
- Compliance requirements per service domain
- Data security classification and handling
- Service isolation for different security levels
- Audit logging requirements per service
- Performance requirements for federal user loads

DECOMPOSITION CRITERIA:
- Business capability alignment
- Data ownership clarity
- Team cognitive load (single developer)
- Technology stack consistency
- Deployment independence

OUTPUT FORMAT:
- Service boundary recommendations with justification
- Data ownership mapping and shared data strategies
- API contract definitions between services
- Migration sequence and timeline
- Implementation complexity assessment

Analyze the current Fed Job Advisor backend and provide detailed service decomposition recommendations with implementation guidance.

## ðŸ§ª Testing & Validation

### Test Scenarios
```python
# Platform architecture testing scenarios
test_cases = [
    {
        "input": {
            "current_architecture": "monolith",
            "expected_users": 10000,
            "compliance_requirements": ["federal_security"]
        },
        "expected_output": {
            "service_count": "3-5 services",
            "migration_complexity": "medium",
            "performance_improvement": "> 20%"
        },
        "success_criteria": [
            "Clear service boundaries defined",
            "Federal compliance maintained",
            "Solo developer implementation feasible"
        ]
    }
]
```

### NO BS Validation
- **Data Honesty**: Performance projections based on industry benchmarks and federal application patterns
- **Capability Limits**: Cannot test actual deployment, provides architectural analysis only
- **Accuracy Claims**: Service recommendations validated against DDD principles and federal requirements
