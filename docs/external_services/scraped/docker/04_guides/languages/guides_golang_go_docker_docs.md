This isn't a Go tutorial. If you are new to the : languages:, the Go website is a great place to explore, so go (pun intended) check it out!You also must know some basic Docker concepts as well as to be at least vaguely familiar with the Dockerfile format.Your Docker set-up must have BuildKit enabled. BuildKit is enabled by default for all users on Docker Desktop. If you have installed Docker Desktop, you don’t have to manually enable BuildKit. If you are running Docker on Linux, please check out BuildKit getting started page.Some familiarity with the command line is also expected.What's next?The aim of this guide is to provide enough examples and instructions for you to containerize your own Go application and deploy it into the Cloud.Start by building your first Go image.ModulesBuild imagesLearn how to build your first Docker image by writing a DockerfileRun containersLearn how to run the image as a container.Develop your appLearn how to develop your application locally.Run your testsHow to build and run your Go tests in a containerConfigure CI/CDLearn how to Configure CI/CD for your Go applicationTest your deploymentLearn how to deploy your Go application
