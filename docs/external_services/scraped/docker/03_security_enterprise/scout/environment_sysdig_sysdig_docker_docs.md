questions with Docs AI ClaudeOpen in ClaudeTable of contentsHow it worksPrerequisitesIntegrate an environmentThe Sysdig integration enables Docker Scout to automatically detect the images you're using for your running workloads. Activating this integration gives you real-time insights about your security posture, and lets you compare your builds with what's running in production.How it worksThe Sysdig Agent captures the images of your container workloads. Docker Scout integrates with the Sysdig API to discover the images in your cluster. This integration uses Sysdig's Risk Spotlight feature. For more information, see Risk Spotlight Integrations (Sysdig docs). TipSysdig offers a free trial for Docker users to try out the new Docker Scout integration.Sign upEach Sysdig integration maps to an environment. When you enable a Sysdig integration, you specify the environment name for that cluster, such as production or staging. Docker Scout assigns the images in the cluster to the corresponding environment. This lets you use the environment filters to see vulnerability status and policy compliance for an environment.Only images analyzed by Docker Scout can be assigned to an environment. The Sysdig runtime integration doesn't trigger image analysis by itself. To analyze images automatically, enable a registry integration.Image analysis must not necessarily precede the runtime integration, but the environment assignment only takes place once Docker Scout has analyzed the image.PrerequisitesInstall the Sysdig Agent in the cluster that you want to integrate, see Install Sysdig Agent (Sysdig docs).Enable profiling for Risk Spotlight Integrations in Sysdig, see Profiling (Sysdig docs).You must be an organization owner to enable the integration in the Docker Scout Dashboard.Integrate an environmentGo to the Sysdig integration page on the Docker Scout Dashboard.In the How to integrate section, enter a configuration name for this integration. Docker Scout uses this label as a display name for the integration.Select Next.Enter a Risk Spotlight API token and select the region in the drop-down list.The Risk Spotlight API token is the Sysdig token that Docker Scout needs to integrate with Sysdig. For more instructions on how to generate a Risk Spotlight token, See Risk Spotlight Integrations (Sysdig docs).The region corresponds to the global.sysdig.region configuration parameter set when deploying the Sysdig Agent.Select Next.After selecting Next, Docker Scout connects to Sysdig and retrieves the cluster names for your Sysdig account. Cluster names correspond to the global.clusterConfig.name configuration parameter set when deploying Sysdig Agents.An error displays if Docker Scout fails to connect to Sysdig using the provided token. If there's an error, you won't be able to continue the integration. Go back and verify that the configuration details are correct.Select a cluster name in the drop-down list.Select Next.Assign an environment name for this cluster.You can reuse an existing environment or create a new one.Select Enable integration.After enabling the integration, Docker Scout automatically detects images running in the cluster, and assigns those images to the environment associated with the cluster. For more information about environments, see Environment monitoring. NoteDocker Scout only detects images that have been analyzed. To trigger an image analysis, enable a registry integration and push an image to your registry.If you created a new environment for this integration, the environment appears in Docker Scout when at least one image has been analyzed.To integrate more clusters, go to the Sysdig integrations page and select the Add button.
