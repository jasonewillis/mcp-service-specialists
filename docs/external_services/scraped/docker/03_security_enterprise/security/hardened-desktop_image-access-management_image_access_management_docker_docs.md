Business For: Administrators Image Access Management lets administrators control which types of images developers can pull from Docker Hub. This prevents developers from accidentally using untrusted community images that could pose security risks to your organization.With Image Access Management, you can restrict access to:Docker Official Images: Curated images maintained by DockerDocker Verified Publisher Images: Images from trusted commercial publishersOrganization images: Your organization's private repositoriesCommunity images: Public images from individual developersWho should use Image Access Management?Image Access Management helps prevent supply chain attacks by ensuring developers only use trusted container images. For example, a developer building a new application might accidentally use a malicious community image as a component. Image Access Management prevents this by restricting access to only approved image types.Common security scenarios include:Prevent use of unmaintained or malicious community imagesEnsure developers use only vetted, official base imagesControl access to commercial third-party imagesMaintain consistent security standards across development teamsPrerequisitesBefore configuring Image Access Management, you must:Enforce sign-in to ensure users authenticate with your organizationUse personal access tokens (PATs) for authentication (Organization access tokens aren't supported)Have a Docker Business subscription ImportantImage Access Management only takes effect when users are signed in to Docker Desktop with organization credentials.Configure image accessTo configure Image Access Management:Sign in to Docker Home and select your organization.Select Admin Console, then Image access.Use the toggle to enable image access.Select which image types to allow:Organization images: Images from your organization (always allowed by default). These can be public or private images created by members within your organization.Community images: Images contributed by various users that may pose security risks. This category includes Docker-Sponsored Open Source images and is turned off by default.Docker Verified Publisher Images: Images from Docker partners in the Verified Publisher program, qualified for secure supply chains.Docker Official Images: Curated Docker repositories that provide OS repositories, best practices for Dockerfiles, drop-in solutions, and timely security updates.Once restrictions are applied, organization members can view the permissions page in read-only format. NoteImage Access Management is turned off by default. Organization owners have access to all images regardless of policy settings.Verify access restrictionsAfter configuring Image Access Management, test that restrictions work correctly.When developers pull allowed image types: $ docker pull nginx # Docker Official Image # Pull succeeds if Docker Official Images are allowed When developers pull blocked image types: $ docker pull someuser/custom-image # Community image Error response from daemon: image access denied: community images not allowed Image access restrictions apply to all Docker Hub operations including pulls, builds using FROM instructions, and Docker Compose services.Security implementationStart with the most restrictive policy and gradually expand based on legitimate business needs:Start with: Docker Official Images and Organization imagesAdd if needed: Docker Verified Publisher Images for commercial toolsCarefully evaluate: Community images only for specific, vetted use casesOther security recommendations include:Monitor usage patterns: Review which images developers are attempting to pull, identify legitimate requests for additional image types, regularly audit approved image categories for continued relevance, and use Docker Desktop analytics to monitor usage patterns.Layer security controls: Image Access Management works best with Registry Access Management to control which registries developers can access, Enhanced Container Isolation to secure containers at runtime, and Settings Management to control Docker Desktop configuration.Scope and bypass considerationsImage Access Management only controls access to Docker Hub images. Images from other registries aren't affected by these policies. Use Registry Access Management to control access to other registries.Users can potentially bypass Image Access Management by signing out of Docker Desktop (unless sign-in is enforced), using images from other registries that aren't restricted, or using registry mirrors or proxies. Enforce sign-in and combine with Registry Access Management for comprehensive control.Image restrictions apply to Dockerfile FROM instructions, Docker Compose services using restricted images will fail, multi-stage builds may be affected if intermediate images are restricted, and CI/CD pipelines using diverse image types may be impacted.
