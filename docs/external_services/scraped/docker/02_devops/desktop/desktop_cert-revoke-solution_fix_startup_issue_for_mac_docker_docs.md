ClaudeOpen in ClaudeTable of contentsAvailable solutionsUpgrade to Docker Desktop version 4.37.2 (recommended)Install a patch if you have version 4.32 - 4.36MDM scriptHomebrew casksThis guide provides steps to address a recent issue affecting some macOS users of Docker Desktop. The issue may prevent Docker Desktop from starting and in some cases, may also trigger inaccurate malware warnings. For more details about the incident, see the blog post. NoteDocker Desktop versions 4.28 and earlier are not impacted by this issue.Available solutionsThere are a few options available depending on your situation:Upgrade to Docker Desktop version 4.37.2 (recommended)The recommended way is to upgrade to the latest Docker Desktop version which is version 4.37.2.If possible, update directly through the app. If not, and you’re still seeing the malware pop-up, follow the steps below:Kill the Docker process that cannot start properly: $ sudo launchctl bootout system/com.docker.vmnetd 2>/dev/null || true $ sudo launchctl bootout system/com.docker.socket 2>/dev/null || true $ sudo rm /Library/PrivilegedHelperTools/com.docker.vmnetd || true $ sudo rm /Library/PrivilegedHelperTools/com.docker.socket || true $ ps aux | grep -i docker | awk '{print $2}' | sudo xargs kill -9 2>/dev/null Make sure the malware pop-up is permanently closed.Download and install version 4.37.2.Launch Docker Desktop. A privileged pop-up message displays after 5 to 10 seconds.Enter your password.You should now see the Docker Desktop Dashboard. TipIf the malware pop-up persists after completing these steps and Docker is in the Trash, try emptying the Trash and rerunning the steps.Install a patch if you have version 4.32 - 4.36If you can’t upgrade to the latest version and you’re seeing the malware pop-up, follow the steps below:Kill the Docker process that cannot start properly: $ sudo launchctl bootout system/com.docker.vmnetd 2>/dev/null || true $ sudo launchctl bootout system/com.docker.socket 2>/dev/null || true $ sudo rm /Library/PrivilegedHelperTools/com.docker.vmnetd || true $ sudo rm /Library/PrivilegedHelperTools/com.docker.socket || true $ ps aux | grep docker | awk '{print $2}' | sudo xargs kill -9 2>/dev/null Make sure the malware pop-up is permanently closed.Download and install the patched installer that matches your current base version. For example if you have version 4.36.0, install 4.36.1.Launch Docker Desktop. A privileged pop-up message displays after 5 to 10 seconds.Enter your password.You should now see the Docker Desktop Dashboard. TipIf the malware pop-up persists after completing these steps and Docker is in the Trash, try emptying the Trash and rerunning the steps.MDM scriptIf you are an IT administrator and your developers are seeing the malware pop-up:Make sure your developers have a re-signed version of Docker Desktop version 4.32 or later.Run the following script: #!/bin/bash # Stop the docker services echo "Stopping Docker..." sudo pkill -i docker # Stop the vmnetd service echo "Stopping com.docker.vmnetd service..." sudo launchctl bootout system /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.docker.vmnetd.plist # Stop the socket service echo "Stopping com.docker.socket service..." sudo launchctl bootout system /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.docker.socket.plist # Remove vmnetd binary echo "Removing com.docker.vmnetd binary..." sudo rm -f /Library/PrivilegedHelperTools/com.docker.vmnetd # Remove socket binary echo "Removing com.docker.socket binary..." sudo rm -f /Library/PrivilegedHelperTools/com.docker.socket # Install new binaries echo "Install new binaries..." sudo cp /Applications/Docker.app/Contents/Library/LaunchServices/com.docker.vmnetd /Library/PrivilegedHelperTools/ sudo cp /Applications/Docker.app/Contents/MacOS/com.docker.socket /Library/PrivilegedHelperTools/ Homebrew casksIf you installed Docker Desktop using Homebrew casks, the recommended solution is to perform a full reinstall to resolve the issue.To reinstall Docker Desktop, run the following commands in your terminal: $ brew update $ brew reinstall --cask docker These commands will update Homebrew and completely reinstall Docker Desktop, ensuring you have the latest version with the fix applied.
