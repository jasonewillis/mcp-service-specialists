ClaudeOpen in ClaudeTable of contentsSetup and useStep one: Run a USB/IP serverStep two: Start a privileged Docker containerStep three: Enter the mount namespace of PID 1Step four: Use the USB/IP toolsStep five: Access the device from another containerRequires: Docker Desktop 4.35.0 and later For: Docker Desktop for Mac, Linux, and Windows with the Hyper-V backendUSB/IP enables you to share USB devices over the network, which can then be accessed from within Docker containers. This page focuses on sharing USB devices connected to the machine you run Docker Desktop on. You can repeat the following process to attach and use additional USB devices as needed. NoteDocker Desktop includes built-in drivers for many common USB devices but Docker can't guarantee every possible USB device works with this setup.Setup and useStep one: Run a USB/IP serverTo use USB/IP, you need to run a USB/IP server. For this guide, the implementation provided by jiegec/usbip will be used.Clone the repository. $ git clone https://github.com/jiegec/usbip $ cd usbip Run the emulated Human Interface Device (HID) device example. $ env RUST_LOG=info cargo run --example hid_keyboard Step two: Start a privileged Docker containerTo attach the USB device, start a privileged Docker container with the PID namespace set to host: $ docker run --rm -it --privileged --pid=host alpine --privileged gives the container full access to the host, and --pid=host allows it to share the host’s process namespace.Step three: Enter the mount namespace of PID 1Inside the container, enter the mount namespace of the init process to gain access to the pre-installed USB/IP tools: $ nsenter -t 1 -m Step four: Use the USB/IP toolsNow you can use the USB/IP tools as you would on any other system:List USB devicesTo list exportable USB devices from the host: $ usbip list -r host.docker.internal Expected output: Exportable USB devices ====================== - host.docker.internal 0-0-0: unknown vendor : unknown product (0000:0000) : /sys/bus/0/0/0 : (Defined at Interface level) (00/00/00) : 0 - unknown class / unknown subclass / unknown protocol (03/00/00) Attach a USB deviceTo attach a specific USB device, or the emulated keyboard in this case: $ usbip attach -r host.docker.internal -d 0-0-0 Verify device attachmentAfter attaching the emulated keyboard, check the /dev/input directory for the device node: $ ls /dev/input/ Example output: event0 mice Step five: Access the device from another containerWhile the initial container remains running to keep the USB device operational, you can access the attached device from another container. For example:Start a new container with the attached device. $ docker run --rm -it --device "/dev/input/event0" alpine Install a tool like evtest to test the emulated keyboard. $ apk add evtest $ evtest /dev/input/event0 Interact with the device, and observe the output.Example output: Input driver version is 1.0.1 Input device ID: bus 0x3 vendor 0x0 product 0x0 version 0x111 ... Properties: Testing ... (interrupt to exit) Event: time 1717575532.881540, type 4 (EV_MSC), code 4 (MSC_SCAN), value 7001e Event: time 1717575532.881540, type 1 (EV_KEY), code 2 (KEY_1), value 1 Event: time 1717575532.881540, -------------- SYN_REPORT ------------ ... ImportantThe initial container must remain running to maintain the connection to the USB device. Exiting the container will stop the device from working.
