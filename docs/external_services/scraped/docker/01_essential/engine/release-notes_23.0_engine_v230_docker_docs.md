ClaudeTable of contents23.0.623.0.523.0.423.0.323.0.223.0.123.0.0 NoteFrom Docker Engine version 23.0.0, Buildx is distributed in a separate package: docker-buildx-plugin. In earlier versions, Buildx was included in the docker-ce-cli package. When you upgrade to this version of Docker Engine, make sure you update all packages. For example, on Ubuntu: $ sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin Refer to the Docker Engine installation instructions for your operating system for more details on upgrading Docker Engine.This page describes the latest changes, additions, known issues, and fixes for Docker Engine version 23.0.For more information about:Deprecated and removed features, see Deprecated Engine Features.Changes to the Engine API, see Engine API version history.Starting with the 23.0.0 release, Docker Engine moves away from using CalVer versioning, and starts using the SemVer versioning format. Changing the version format is a stepping-stone towards Go module compatibility, but the repository doesn't yet use Go modules, and still requires using a "+incompatible" version. Work continues towards Go module compatibility in a future release.23.0.62023-05-08For a full list of pull requests and changes in this release, refer to the relevant GitHub milestones:docker/cli, 23.0.6 milestonemoby/moby, 23.0.6 milestoneBug fixes and enhancementsFix vfs storage driver not working on NFS. moby/moby#45465Packaging UpdatesUpgrade Go to 1.19.9. docker/docker-ce-packaging#889, docker/cli#4254, moby/moby#45455Upgrade containerd to v1.6.21Upgrade runc to v1.1.723.0.52023-04-26For a full list of pull requests and changes in this release, refer to the relevant GitHub milestones:docker/cli, 23.0.5 milestonemoby/moby, 23.0.5 milestoneBug fixes and enhancementsAdd the --all / -a option when pruning volumes. docker/cli#4229Add --format=json for docker info. docker/cli#4320Fix log loss with the AWSLogs log driver. moby/moby#45350Fix a regression introduced in v23.0.4 where dockerd would refuse to start if the fixed-cidr config parameter is provided but not bip. moby/moby#45403Fix a panic in libnetwork during daemon start moby/moby#45376Fix "tag" event not being sent when an image is built with buildx. moby/moby#45410Packaging UpdatesUpgrade Compose to 2.17.3. docker/docker-ce-packaging#88323.0.42023-04-17For a full list of pull requests and changes in this release, refer to the relevant GitHub milestones:docker/cli, 23.0.4 milestonemoby/moby, 23.0.4 milestoneBug fixes and enhancementsFix a performance regression in Docker CLI 23.0.0 docker/cli#4141.Fix progress indicator on docker cp not functioning as intended docker/cli#4157.Fix shell completion for docker compose --file docker/cli#4177.Fix an error caused by incorrect handling of "default-address-pools" in daemon.json moby/moby#45246.Packaging UpdatesFix missing packages for CentOS 9 Stream.Upgrade Go to 1.19.8. docker/docker-ce-packaging#878, docker/cli#4164, moby/moby#45277, which contains fixes for CVE-2023-24537, CVE-2023-24538, CVE-2023-24534, and CVE-2023-2453623.0.32023-04-04 NoteDue to an issue with CentOS 9 Stream's package repositories, packages for CentOS 9 are currently unavailable. Packages for CentOS 9 may be added later, or as part of the next (23.0.4) patch release.Bug fixes and enhancementsFixed a number of issues that can cause Swarm encrypted overlay networks to fail to uphold their guarantees, addressing CVE-2023-28841, CVE-2023-28840, and CVE-2023-28842.A lack of kernel support for encrypted overlay networks now reports as an error.Encrypted overlay networks are eagerly set up, rather than waiting for multiple nodes to attach.Encrypted overlay networks are now usable on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 through the use of the xt_bpf kernel module.Users of Swarm overlay networks should review GHSA-vwm3-crmr-xfxw to ensure that unintentional exposure has not occurred.Packaging UpdatesUpgrade containerd to v1.6.20.Upgrade runc to v1.1.5.23.0.22023-03-28For a full list of pull requests and changes in this release, refer to the relevant GitHub milestones:docker/cli, 23.0.2 milestonemoby/moby, 23.0.2 milestoneBug fixes and enhancementsFully resolve missing checks for apparmor_parser when an AppArmor enabled kernel is detected. containerd/containerd#8087, moby/moby#45043Ensure that credentials are redacted from Git URLs when generating BuildKit buildinfo.

The error message indicates that the issue is due to a missing apparmor_parser binary: Error response from daemon: AppArmor enabled on system but the docker-default profile could not be loaded: running `apparmor_parser apparmor_parser --version` failed with output: error: exec: "apparmor_parser": executable file not found in $PATH Error: failed to start containers: somecontainer The workaround to this issue is to install the apparmor package manually: apt-get install apparmor BuildKit inline cache (tracking issue)Attempting to build an image with BuildKit's inline cache feature (e.g. docker build --build-arg BUILDKIT_INLINE_CACHE=1 ., docker buildx build --cache-to type=inline .) will result in the daemon unexpectedly exiting: panic: runtime error: invalid memory address or nil pointer dereference [signal SIGSEGV: segmentation violation code=0x1 addr=0x18 pc=0x147ff00] goroutine 693 [running]: github.com/docker/docker/vendor/github.com/moby/buildkit/cache.computeBlobChain.func4.1({0x245cca8, 0x4001394960}) /go/src/github.com/docker/docker/vendor/github.com/moby/buildkit/cache/blobs.go:206 +0xc90 github.com/docker/docker/vendor/github.com/moby/buildkit/util/flightcontrol.(*call).run(0x40013c2240) /go/src/github.com/docker/docker/vendor/github.com/moby/buildkit/util/flightcontrol/flightcontrol.go:121 +0x64 sync.(*Once).doSlow(0x0?, 0x4001328240?) /usr/local/go/src/sync/once.go:74 +0x100 sync.(*Once).Do(0x4001328240?, 0x0?) /usr/local/go/src/sync/once.go:65 +0x24 created by github.com/docker/docker/vendor/github.com/moby/buildkit/util/flightcontrol.(*call).waitThe daemon will restart if configured to do so (e.g. via systemd) after such a crash. The only available mitigation in this release is to avoid performing builds with the inline cache feature enabled.BuildKit with warm cache (tracking issue)If an image was built with BuildKit on a previous version of the daemon, and is built with a 23.0 daemon, previously cached layers will not be restored correctly. The image may appear to build correctly if no lines are changed in the Dockerfile; however, if partial cache invalidation occurs due to changing some lines in the Dockerfile, the still valid and previously cached layers will not be loaded correctly.This most often presents as files that should be present in the image not being present in a RUN stage, or any other stage that references files, after changing some lines in the Dockerfile: [+] Building 0.4s (6/6) FINISHED => [internal] load build definition from Dockerfile => => transferring dockerfile: 102B => [internal] load .dockerignore => => transferring context: 2B => [internal] load metadata for docker.io/library/node:18-alpine => [base 1/2] FROM docker.io/library/node:18-alpine@sha256:bc329c7332cffc30c2d4801e38df03cbfa8dcbae2a7a52a449db104794f168a3 => CACHED [base 2/2] WORKDIR /app => ERROR [stage-1 1/1] RUN uname -a ------ > [stage-1 1/1] RUN uname -a: #0 0.138 runc run failed: unable to start container process: exec: "/bin/sh": stat /bin/sh: no such file or directory ------ Dockerfile:5 -------------------- 3 | 4 | FROM base 5 | >>> RUN uname -a 6 | -------------------- ERROR: failed to solve: process "/bin/sh -c uname -a" did not complete successfully: exit code: 1To mitigate this, the previous build cache must be discarded. docker builder prune -a will completely empty the build cache, and allow the affected builds to proceed again by removing the mishandled cache layers.ipvlan networks (tracking issue)When upgrading to the 23.0 branch, the existence of any ipvlan networks will prevent the daemon from starting: panic: interface conversion: interface {} is nil, not string goroutine 1 [running]: github.com/docker/docker/libnetwork/drivers/ipvlan.(*configuration).UnmarshalJSON(0x40011533b0, {0x400069c2d0, 0xef, 0xef}) /go/src/github.com/docker/docker/libnetwork/drivers/ipvlan/ipvlan_store.go:196 +0x414 encoding/json.(*decodeState).object(0x4001153440, {0x5597157640?, 0x40011533b0?, 0x559524115c?}) /usr/local/go/src/encoding/json/decode.go:613 +0x650 encoding/json.(*decodeState).value(0x4001153440, {0x5597157640?, 0x40011533b0?, 0x559524005c?}) /usr/local/go/src/encoding/json/decode.go:374 +0x40 encoding/json.(*decodeState).unmarshal(0x4001153440, {0x5597157640?, 0x40011533b0?}) /usr/local/go/src/encoding/json/decode.go:181 +0x204 encoding/json.Unmarshal({0x400069c2d0, 0xef, 0xef}, {0x5597157640, 0x40011533b0}) /usr/local/go/src/encoding/json/decode.go:108 +0xf4 github.com/docker/docker/libnetwork/drivers/ipvlan.(*configuration).SetValue(0x4000d18050?, {0x400069c2d0?, 0x23?, 0x23?}) /go/src/github.com/docker/docker/libnetwork/drivers/ipvlan/ipvlan_store.go:230 +0x38To mitigate this, affected users can downgrade and remove the network, then upgrade again. Alternatively, the entire network store can be removed, and networks can be recreated after the upgrade. The network store is located at /var/lib/docker/network/files/local-kv.db. If the daemon is using an alternate --data-root, substitute /var/lib/docker for the alternate path.Kata Containers (tracking issue)The 23.0 branch brings support for alternate containerd shims, such as io.containerd.runsc.v1 (gVisor) and io.containerd.kata.v2 (Kata Containers).When using the Kata Containers runtime, exiting an exec session stops the running container, and hangs the connected CLI if a TTY was opened. There is no mitigation at this time beyond avoiding execing into containers running on the Kata runtime.The root cause of this issue is a long-standing bug in Moby. This will be resolved in a future release. Be advised that support for alternate OCI runtimes is a new feature and that similar issues may be discovered as more users start exercising this functionality.
