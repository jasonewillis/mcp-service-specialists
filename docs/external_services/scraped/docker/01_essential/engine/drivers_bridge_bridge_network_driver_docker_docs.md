network is a Link Layer device which forwards traffic between network segments. A bridge can be a hardware device or a software device running within a host machine's kernel.In terms of Docker, a bridge network uses a software bridge which lets containers connected to the same bridge network communicate, while providing isolation from containers that aren't connected to that bridge network. The Docker bridge driver automatically installs rules in the host machine so that containers on different bridge networks can't communicate directly with each other.Bridge networks apply to containers running on the same Docker daemon host. For communication among containers running on different Docker daemon hosts, you can either manage routing at the OS level, or you can use an overlay network.When you start Docker, a default bridge network (also called bridge) is created automatically, and newly-started containers connect to it unless otherwise specified. You can also create user-defined custom bridge networks. User-defined bridge networks are superior to the default bridge network.Differences between user-defined bridges and the default bridgeUser-defined bridges provide automatic DNS resolution between containers.Containers on the default bridge network can only access each other by IP addresses, unless you use the --link option, which is considered legacy. On a user-defined bridge network, containers can resolve each other by name or alias.Imagine an application with a web front-end and a database back-end. If you call your containers web and db, the web container can connect to the db container at db, no matter which Docker host the application stack is running on.If you run the same application stack on the default bridge network, you need to manually create links between the containers (using the legacy --link flag). These links need to be created in both directions, so you can see this gets complex with more than two containers which need to communicate. Alternatively, you can manipulate the /etc/hosts files within the containers, but this creates problems that are difficult to debug.User-defined bridges provide better isolation.All containers without a --network specified, are attached to the default bridge network. This can be a risk, as unrelated stacks/services/containers are then able to communicate.Using a user-defined network provides a scoped network in which only containers attached to that network are able to communicate.Containers can be attached and detached from user-defined networks on the fly.During a container's lifetime, you can connect or disconnect it from user-defined networks on the fly. To remove a container from the default bridge network, you need to stop the container and recreate it with different network options.Each user-defined network creates a configurable bridge.If your containers use the default bridge network, you can configure it, but all the containers use the same settings, such as MTU and iptables rules. In addition, configuring the default bridge network happens outside of Docker itself, and requires a restart of Docker.User-defined bridge networks are created and configured using docker network create. If different groups of applications have different network requirements, you can configure each user-defined bridge separately, as you create it.Linked containers on the default bridge network share environment variables.Originally, the only way to share environment variables between two containers was to link them using the --link flag. This type of variable sharing isn't possible with user-defined networks. However, there are superior ways to share environment variables. A few ideas:Multiple containers can mount a file or directory containing the shared information, using a Docker volume.Multiple containers can be started together using docker-compose and the compose file can define the shared variables.You can use swarm services instead of standalone containers, and take advantage of shared secrets and configs.Containers connected to the same user-defined bridge network effectively expose all ports to each other. For a port to be accessible to containers or non-Docker hosts on different networks, that port must be published using the -p or --publish flag.OptionsThe following table describes the driver-specific options that you can pass to --opt when creating a custom network using the bridge driver.OptionDefaultDescriptioncom.docker.network.bridge.nameInterface name to use when creating the Linux bridge.com.docker.network.bridge.enable_ip_masqueradetrueEnable IP masquerading.com.docker.network.bridge.gateway_mode_ipv4com.docker.network.bridge.gateway_mode_ipv6natControl external connectivity. See Packet filtering and firewalls.com.docker.network.bridge.enable_icctrueEnable or Disable inter-container connectivity.com.docker.network.bridge.host_binding_ipv4all IPv4 and IPv6 addressesDefault IP when binding container ports.com.docker.network.driver.mtu0 (no limit)Set the containers network Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU).com.docker.network.container_iface_prefixethSet a custom prefix for container interfaces.com.docker.network.bridge.inhibit_ipv4falsePrevent Docker from assigning an IP address to the bridge.Some of these options are also available as flags to the dockerd CLI, and you can use them to configure the default docker0 bridge when starting the Docker daemon. The following table shows which options have equivalent flags in the dockerd CLI.OptionFlagcom.docker.network.bridge.name-com.docker.network.bridge.enable_ip_masquerade--ip-masqcom.docker.network.bridge.enable_icc--icccom.docker.network.bridge.host_binding_ipv4--ipcom.docker.network.driver.mtu--mtucom.docker.network.container_iface_prefix-The Docker daemon supports a --bridge flag, which you can use to define your own docker0 bridge. Use this option if you want to run multiple daemon instances on the same host. For details, see Run multiple daemons.Default host binding addressWhen no host address is given in port publishing options like -p 80 or -p 8080:80, the default is to make the container's port 80 available on all host addresses, IPv4 and IPv6.The bridge network driver option com.docker.network.bridge.host_binding_ipv4 can be used to modify the default address for published ports.Despite the option's name, it is possible to specify an IPv6 address.When the default binding address is an address assigned to a specific interface, the container's port will only be accessible via that address.Setting the default binding address to :: means published ports will only be available on the host's IPv6 addresses. However, setting it to 0.0.0.0 means it will be available on the host's IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.To restrict a published port to IPv4 only, the address must be included in the container's publishing options. For example, -p 0.0.0.0:8080:80.Manage a user-defined bridgeUse the docker network create command to create a user-defined bridge network. $ docker network create my-net You can specify the subnet, the IP address range, the gateway, and other options. See the docker network create reference or the output of docker network create --help for details.Use the docker network rm command to remove a user-defined bridge network. If containers are currently connected to the network, disconnect them first. $ docker network rm my-net What's really happening?When you create or remove a user-defined bridge or connect or disconnect a container from a user-defined bridge, Docker uses tools specific to the operating system to manage the underlying network infrastructure (such as adding or removing bridge devices or configuring iptables rules on Linux). These details should be considered implementation details. Let Docker manage your user-defined networks for you.Connect a container to a user-defined bridgeWhen you create a new container, you can specify one or more --network flags. This example connects an Nginx container to the my-net network. It also publishes port 80 in the container to port 8080 on the Docker host, so external clients can access that port. Any other container connected to the my-net network has access to all ports on the my-nginx container, and vice versa. $ docker create --name my-nginx \ --network my-net \ --publish 8080:80 \ nginx:latest To connect a running container to an existing user-defined bridge, use the docker network connect command. The following command connects an already-running my-nginx container to an already-existing my-net network: $ docker network connect my-net my-nginx Disconnect a container from a user-defined bridgeTo disconnect a running container from a user-defined bridge, use the docker network disconnect command. The following command disconnects the my-nginx container from the my-net network. $ docker network disconnect my-net my-nginx Use IPv6 in a user-defined bridge networkWhen you create your network, you can specify the --ipv6 flag to enable IPv6. $ docker network create --ipv6 --subnet 2001:db8:1234::/64 my-net If you do not provide a --subnet option, a Unique Local Address (ULA) prefix will be chosen automatically.IPv6-only bridge networksTo skip IPv4 address configuration on the bridge and in its containers, create the network with option --ipv4=false, and enable IPv6 using --ipv6. $ docker network create --ipv6 --ipv4=false v6net IPv4 address configuration cannot be disabled in the default bridge network.Use the default bridge networkThe default bridge network is considered a legacy detail of Docker and is not recommended for production use. Configuring it is a manual operation, and it has technical shortcomings.Connect a container to the default bridge networkIf you do not specify a network using the --network flag, and you do specify a network driver, your container is connected to the default bridge network by default. Containers connected to the default bridge network can communicate, but only by IP address, unless they're linked using the legacy --link flag.Configure the default bridge networkTo configure the default bridge network, you specify options in daemon.json. Here is an example daemon.json with several options specified. Only specify the settings you need to customize. { "bip": "192.168.1.1/24", "fixed-cidr": "192.168.1.0/25", "mtu": 1500, "default-gateway": "192.168.1.254", "dns": ["10.20.1.2","10.20.1.3"] }In this example:The bridge's address is "192.168.1.1/24" (from bip).The bridge network's subnet is "192.168.1.0/24" (from bip).Container addresses will be allocated from "192.168.1.0/25" (from fixed-cidr).Use IPv6 with the default bridge networkIPv6 can be enabled for the default bridge using the following options in daemon.json, or their command line equivalents.These three options only affect the default bridge, they are not used by user-defined networks. The addresses in below are examples from the IPv6 documentation range.Option ipv6 is required.Option bip6 is optional, it specifies the address of the default bridge, which will be used as the default gateway by containers. It also specifies the subnet for the bridge network.Option fixed-cidr-v6 is optional, it specifies the address range Docker may automatically allocate to containers.The prefix should normally be /64 or shorter.For experimentation on a local network, it is better to use a Unique Local Address (ULA) prefix (matching fd00::/8) than a Link Local prefix (matching fe80::/10).Option default-gateway-v6 is optional. If unspecified, the default is the first address in the fixed-cidr-v6 subnet. { "ipv6": true, "bip6": "2001:db8::1111/64", "fixed-cidr-v6": "2001:db8::/64", "default-gateway-v6": "2001:db8:abcd::89" }If no bip6 is specified, fixed-cidr-v6 defines the subnet for the bridge network. If no bip6 or fixed-cidr-v6 is specified, a ULA prefix will be chosen.Restart Docker for changes to take effect.Connection limit for bridge networksDue to limitations set by the Linux kernel, bridge networks become unstable and inter-container communications may break when 1000 containers or more connect to a single network.For more information about this limitation, see moby/moby#44973.Skip Bridge IP address configurationThe bridge is normally assigned the network's --gateway address, which is used as the default route from the bridge network to other networks.The com.docker.network.bridge.inhibit_ipv4 option lets you create a network without the IPv4 gateway address being assigned to the bridge. This is useful if you want to configure the gateway IP address for the bridge manually. For instance if you add a physical interface to your bridge, and need it to have the gateway address.With this configuration, north-south traffic (to and from the bridge network) won't work unless you've manually configured the gateway address on the bridge, or a device attached to it.This option can only be used with user-defined bridge networks.Next stepsGo through the standalone networking tutorialLearn about networking from the container's point of viewLearn about overlay networksLearn about Macvlan networks Edit this page Request changesTable of contentsDifferences between user-defined bridges and the default bridgeOptionsDefault host binding addressManage a user-defined bridgeConnect a container to a user-defined bridgeDisconnect a container from a user-defined bridgeUse IPv6 in a user-defined bridge networkIPv6-only bridge networksUse the default bridge networkConnect a container to the default bridge networkConfigure the default bridge networkUse IPv6 with the default bridge networkConnection limit for bridge networksSkip Bridge IP address configurationNext steps
