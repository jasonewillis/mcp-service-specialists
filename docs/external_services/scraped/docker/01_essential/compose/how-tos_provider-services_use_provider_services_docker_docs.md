of contentsWhat are provider services?Using provider servicesHow it worksProvider typesBenefits of using provider servicesCreating your own providerReferenceRequires: Docker Compose 2.36.0 and later Docker Compose supports provider services, which allow integration with services whose lifecycles are managed by third-party components rather than by Compose itself.This feature enables you to define and utilize platform-specific services without the need for manual setup or direct lifecycle management.What are provider services?Provider services are a special type of service in Compose that represents platform capabilities rather than containers. They allow you to declare dependencies on specific platform features that your application needs.When you define a provider service in your Compose file, Compose works with the platform to provision and configure the requested capability, making it available to your application services.Using provider servicesTo use a provider service in your Compose file, you need to:Define a service with the provider attributeSpecify the type of provider you want to useConfigure any provider-specific optionsDeclare dependencies from your application services to the provider serviceHere's a basic example: services: database: provider: type: awesomecloud options: type: mysql foo: bar app: image: myapp depends_on: - databaseNotice the dedicated provider attribute in the database service. This attribute specifies that the service is managed by a provider and lets you define options specific to that provider type.The depends_on attribute in the app service specifies that it depends on the database service. This means that the database service will be started before the app service, allowing the provider information to be injected into the app service.How it worksDuring the docker compose up command execution, Compose identifies services relying on providers and works with them to provision the requested capabilities. The provider then populates Compose model with information about how to access the provisioned resource.This information is passed to services that declare a dependency on the provider service, typically through environment variables. The naming convention for these variables is: <<PROVIDER_SERVICE_NAME>>_<<VARIABLE_NAME>>For example, if your provider service is named database, your application service might receive environment variables like:DATABASE_URL with the URL to access the provisioned resourceDATABASE_TOKEN with an authentication tokenOther provider-specific variablesYour application can then use these environment variables to interact with the provisioned resource.Provider typesThe type field in a provider service references the name of either:A Docker CLI plugin (e.g., docker-model)A binary available in the user's PATHWhen Compose encounters a provider service, it looks for a plugin or binary with the specified name to handle the provisioning of the requested capability.For example, if you specify type: model, Compose will look for a Docker CLI plugin named docker-model or a binary named model in the PATH. services: ai-runner: provider: type: model # Looks for docker-model plugin or model binary options: model: ai/example-modelThe plugin or binary is responsible for:Interpreting the options provided in the provider serviceProvisioning the requested capabilityReturning information about how to access the provisioned resourceThis information is then passed to dependent services as environment variables. TipIf you're working with AI models in Compose, use the models top-level element instead.Benefits of using provider servicesUsing provider services in your Compose applications offers several benefits:Simplified configuration: You don't need to manually configure and manage platform capabilitiesDeclarative approach: You can declare all your application's dependencies in one placeConsistent workflow: You use the same Compose commands to manage your entire application, including platform capabilitiesCreating your own providerIf you want to create your own provider to extend Compose with custom capabilities, you can implement a Compose plugin that registers provider types.For detailed information on how to create and implement your own provider, refer to the Compose Extensions documentation.This guide explains the extension mechanism that allows you to add new provider types to Compose.ReferenceDocker Model Runner documentationCompose Extensions documentation Edit this page Request changesTable of contentsWhat are provider services?Using provider servicesHow it worksProvider typesBenefits of using provider servicesCreating your own providerReference
