HomeProduct WalkthroughsReleasesRelease Details Copy pageRelease DetailsLearn more about the details of individual releases.The Release Details page focuses on an individual release. Elements of the release are displayed, such as visualized trends for crashes and sessions, specifics regarding each issue, adoption graphs, and commit author breakdowns.GraphsThe graph at the top of the page provides insights into the health of your release by allowing you to choose which metric it displays. Select the time range that you want to review (the default range is the entire release period) and choose from these metrics in the table below the graph:Crash Free Session RateHealthy, Abnormal, Errored session rateCrash Free User RateCrashed Session RateCrashed User RateFailure RateSession CountError CountTransaction CountIn the table below the graph, percentage-based metrics of this release are compared to the average of all releases, so you can spot any differences in trend.Errored sessions are likely to result in handled issues, and crashed sessions in unhandled issues. Click on the issues links to see them in the Issues page.Click on any option in the graph legend to hide it. For example, in a "Session Count" graph, you might hide "Healthy" sessions to see "Crashed" ones in better scale. In the image below, the healthy sessions are displayed, but there are so many healthy sessions compared to all other session types that the crashed ones become invisible in the graph:By hiding the healthy (and errored) sessions, you can actually see the very small number of crashed sessions:Hover over specific dates and times in the overview graph for a quick perspective of events that crashed, behaved abnormally, errored, or are healthy, as defined for release health. The graph also displays markers showing adoption stage changes when you view a time period where that is applicable (and you've filtered by a single environment).IssuesUse the Release Details page to view issues associated with this release and to access them for triage.
