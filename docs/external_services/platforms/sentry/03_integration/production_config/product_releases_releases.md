HomeProduct WalkthroughsReleases Copy pageReleasesLearn how to provide Sentry with important information about your releases, such as release health and release details, to determine regressions and resolve issues faster.If you're looking for the latest Sentry SDK release details, head on over to Sentry's GitHub profile, find your specific SDK repo, and browse the tags for releases.A release is a version of your code deployed to an environment. When you notify Sentry about a release, you can easily identify new issues and regressions, determine whether an issue was resolved, and monitor the health of your newly deployed app. The Releases page provides a visualization of your releases. It presents adoption of releases from the past 24 hours and provides a high-level view of:Each release version (a short version of the release name without the hash)The associated projectThe adoption stage of each releaseThe authors of each commitThe percentage of crash-free usersThe percentage of crash-free sessionsNotifying Sentry of a release enables auto discovery of which commits to associate with a release and identifies what we consider "the most recent release" when searching in sentry.io.Each release links to one or more projects. If a release has multiple projects, Sentry will duplicate the release data in relation to each one. From this page, you can also click any release to go to Release Details for more information.Releases offer significant additional features when fully configured:Determine the issues and regressions introduced in a new releasePredict which commit caused an issue and who is likely responsibleResolve issues by including the issue number in your commit messageReceive email notifications when your code gets deployedWe recommend notifying Sentry about a new release before deploying it. But if you don't, Sentry will automatically create a release entity in the system the first time it sees an event with that release identifier.You don't need a repository integration for any of these features, though we recommend installing one as part of an automated release option for efficiency.Associate Commits in ReleasesWith releases, you can associate commits, which keeps track of the commits that were used in a release.You can resolve issues quickly using the Release Details page to view which commits were used to create a release as the list of authors of those commits.Track Release HealthRelease health provides insight into the impact of crashes and bugs as it relates to your user's experience and reveals trends with each new issue. Monitor release health by observing user adoption, usage of the application, percentage of crashes, and session data. You can explore the health of a release more closely in the Release Details page.You can view release health data either from the Issue Details page by selecting the commit ID listed under Last Seen", or from the Releases page.3 Different Ways to Resolve IssuesIf you'd like to mark an issue as resolved in both a current and a future release, you can do so by resolving it in a release via the dropdown on the issue details page.There are several options for resolving a release issue. If you'd like to leave the release issue unresolved and be notified of it the next time any event is seen in a release, click the main "Resolve" button. But if you'd like to ignore the release issue until it's seen again in your current or next release, you can select "Resolved In The next release" or "Resolved In The current release" from the dropdown.Resolved in the Current ReleaseThe "Resolved in the current release" option records the current release that's displayed in the UI. New events for the release issue are compared against the recorded release version to determine if the issue should unresolve. If the release version is using semver, the issue will be marked as unresolved if the release is from a semver version that's greater than the resolved version. If the release is not using semver, the release creation dates will be compared.Resolved in the Next ReleaseThe "Resolved in the next release" option works like resolving in the current release, but since the next release doesn‚Äôt exist yet, we record the latest version where the issue was seen. This updates automatically when a new release is created. For semantic versioning, the issue is resolved in the next newest of all current versions.Resolved in a CommitThe "Resolved in a commit" option allows you to wait for a release with the specified commit to be created. Once the release is created, new events get checked against the release version or release date. If the new events are from a newer release, the issue gets marked as a regression and appears in your For Review tab to be triaged.Learn More About ReleasesSet UpLearn about setting up your SDK to enable Releases and to monitor release health.Associate CommitsLearn how to associate commits with a release.UsageLearn how to sort, filter, archive, and restore a release.Release DetailsLearn more about the details of individual releases.Release HealthMonitor the health of releases by observing user adoption, usage of the application, percentage of crashes, and session data.Using Releases Across SentryLearn how to use releases throughout Sentry's product.PreviousDashboardsNextSet UpWas this helpful?Yes üëçNo üëéHow can we improve this page?Submit feedbackHelp improve this contentOur documentation is open source and available on GitHub.
