# Browser JavaScript | Sentry for JavaScript

<!-- DEV: HomePlatformsJavaScript Copy pageBrowser JavaScriptAI Rules for Code EditorsCopy RulesSentry provides a set of rules you can use to help your LLM use Sentry correctly. Copy this file and add it to your projects rules configuration. When created as a rules file this should be placed alongside other editor specific rule files. For example, if you are using Cursor, place this file in the .cursorrules directory.Markdownrules.mdCopiedThese examples should be used as guidance when configuring Sentry functionality within a project. # Error / Exception Tracking - Use `Sentry.captureException(error)` to capture an exception and log the error in Sentry. - Use this in try catch blocks or areas where exceptions are expected # Tracing Examples - Spans should be created for meaningful actions within an applications like button clicks, API calls, and function calls - Use the `Sentry.startSpan` function to create a span - Child spans can exist within a parent span ## Custom Span instrumentation in component actions - Name custom spans with meaningful names and operations. - Attach attributes based on relevant information and metrics from the request ```javascript function TestComponent() { const handleTestButtonClick = () => { // Create a transaction/span to measure performance Sentry.startSpan( { op: "ui.click", name: "Test Button Click", }, (span) => { const value = "some config"; const metric = "some metric"; // Metrics can be added to the span span.setAttribute("config", value); span.setAttribute("metric", metric); doSomething(); }, ); }; return ( <button type="button" onClick={handleTestButtonClick}> Test Sentry </button> ); } ``` ## Custom span instrumentation in API calls - Name custom spans with meaningful names and operations. - Attach attributes based on relevant information and metrics from the request ```javascript async function fetchUserData(userId) { return Sentry.startSpan( { op: "http.client", name: `GET /api/users/${userId}`, }, async () => { const response = await fetch(`/api/users/${userId}`); const data = await response.json(); return data; }, ); } ``` # Logs - Where logs are used, ensure Sentry is imported using `import * as Sentry from "@sentry/browser"` - Enable logging in Sentry using `Sentry.init({ enableLogs: true })` - Reference the logger using `const { logger } = Sentry` - Sentry offers a `consoleLoggingIntegration` that can be used to log specific console error types automatically without instrumenting the individual logger calls ## Configuration ### Baseline ```javascript import * as Sentry from "@sentry/browser"; Sentry.init({ dsn: "https://examplePublicKey@o0.ingest.sentry.io/0", enableLogs: true, }); ``` ### Logger Integration ```javascript Sentry.init({ dsn: "https://examplePublicKey@o0.ingest.sentry.io/0", integrations: [ // send console.log, console.error, and console.warn calls as logs to Sentry Sentry.consoleLoggingIntegration({ levels: ["log", "error", "warn"] }), ], }); ``` ## Logger Examples `logger.fmt` is a template literal function that should be used to bring variables into the structured logs. ```javascript import * as Sentry from "@sentry/browser"; const { logger } = Sentry; logger.trace("Starting database connection", { database: "users" }); logger.debug(logger.fmt`Cache miss for user: ${userId}`); logger.info("Updated profile", { profileId: 345 }); logger.warn("Rate limit reached for endpoint", { endpoint: "/api/results/", isEnterprise: false, }); logger.error("Failed to process payment", { orderId: "order_123", amount: 99.99, }); logger.fatal("Database connection pool exhausted", { database: "users", activeConnections: 100, }); ``` Using a framework?Check out the other SDKs we support in the left-hand dropdown.PrerequisitesYou need:A Sentry account and projectYour application up and runningInstallSentry captures data by using an SDK within your application's runtime.In order to get started using the Sentry JavaScript SDK, add the following code to the top of your application, before all other scripts:HTMLCopied<script src="https://js.sentry-cdn.com/examplePublicKey.min.js" crossorigin="anonymous" ></script> The Loader Script allows you to configure some SDK features from the Sentry UI, without having to redeploy your application. The Loader Script documentation shows more information about how to use it.Alternatively, you can also install the SDK via a package manager:npmyarnpnpmCopiednpm install @sentry/browser --save We also support installation via CDN bundles.If you're updating your Sentry SDK to the latest version, check out our migration guide to learn more about breaking changes.If you are using our previous Browser JavaScript SDK, you can access the legacy SDK documentation, until further notice.ConfigureConfiguration should happen as early as possible in your application's lifecycle.Error MonitoringLogsSession ReplayTracingUser FeedbackOnce this is done, Sentry's JavaScript SDK will capture all unhandled exceptions, transactions, and Session Replays, based on the sample rates set.Note, that configuration differs slightly depending on how you installed the Sentry SDK. Make sure to follow the instructions in the correct tab, depending on if you installed the Sentry SDK via NPM, using the Loader Script, or via CDN.npmLoaderCDNCopiedimport * as Sentry from "@sentry/browser"; Sentry.init({ dsn: "https://examplePublicKey@o0.ingest.sentry.io/0", // Adds request headers and IP for users, for more info visit: // https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/configuration/options/#sendDefaultPii sendDefaultPii: true, // Alternatively, use `process.env.npm_package_version` for a dynamic release version // if your build tool supports it. release: "my-project-name@2.3.12", integrations: [ // performance Sentry.browserTracingIntegration(), // performance // session-replay Sentry.replayIntegration(), // session-replay // user-feedback Sentry.feedbackIntegration({ // Additional SDK configuration goes in here, for example: colorScheme: "system", }), // user-feedback ], // logs // Enable logs to be sent to Sentry enableLogs: true, // logs // performance // Set tracesSampleRate to 1.0 to capture 100% // of transactions for tracing. // We recommend adjusting this value in production // Learn more at // https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/configuration/options/#traces-sample-rate tracesSampleRate: 1.0, // Set `tracePropagationTargets` to control for which URLs trace propagation should be enabled tracePropagationTargets: ["localhost", /^https:\/\/yourserver\.io\/api/], // performance // session-replay // Capture Replay for 10% of all sessions, // plus for 100% of sessions with an error // Learn more at // https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/session-replay/configuration/#general-integration-configuration replaysSessionSampleRate: 0.1, replaysOnErrorSampleRate: 1.0, // session-replay }); Add Readable Stack Traces to ErrorsDepending on how you've set up your project, the stack traces in your Sentry errors probably won't look like your actual code.To fix this, upload your source maps to Sentry. The easiest way to do this is by using the Sentry Wizard:BashCopiednpx @sentry/wizard@latest -i sourcemaps The wizard will guide you through the following steps:Logging into Sentry and selecting a projectInstalling the necessary Sentry packagesConfiguring your build tool to generate and upload source mapsConfiguring your CI to upload source mapsFor more information on source maps or for more options to upload them, head over to our Source Maps documentation.VerifyThis snippet includes an intentional error, so you can test that everything is working as soon as you set it up.JavaScriptCopiedsetTimeout(() => { throw new Error("Sentry Test Error"); }); Errors triggered from within Browser DevTools are sandboxed and won't trigger an error handler. Place the snippet directly in your code instead.Learn more about manually capturing an error or message in our Usage documentation.To view and resolve the recorded error, log into sentry.io and select your project. Clicking on the error's title will open a page where you can see detailed information and mark it as resolved.PreviousWelcome to SentryNextInstallation MethodsWas this helpful?Yes 👍No 👎How can we improve this page?Submit feedbackHelp improve this contentOur documentation is open source and available on GitHub.
