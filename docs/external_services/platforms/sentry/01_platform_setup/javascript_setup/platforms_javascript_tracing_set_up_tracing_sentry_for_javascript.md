# Set Up Tracing | Sentry for JavaScript

<!-- DEV: HomePlatformsJavaScriptTracing Copy pageSet Up TracingLearn how to enable tracing in your app.With tracing, Sentry automatically tracks your software performance across your application services, measuring metrics like throughput and latency, and displaying the impact of errors across multiple systems.ConfigureEnable tracing by configuring the sampling rate for traces. Set the sample rate as follows:JavaScriptCopied// If you're using one of our framework SDK packages, like `@sentry/react`, // substitute its name for `@sentry/browser` here import * as Sentry from "@sentry/browser"; Sentry.init({ dsn: "https://examplePublicKey@o0.ingest.sentry.io/0", // This enables automatic instrumentation (highly recommended), // but is not necessary for purely manual usage // If you only want to use custom instrumentation: // * Remove the `BrowserTracing` integration // * add `Sentry.addTracingExtensions()` above your Sentry.init() call integrations: [Sentry.browserTracingIntegration()], // We recommend adjusting this value in production, or using tracesSampler // for finer control tracesSampleRate: 1.0, // Set `tracePropagationTargets` to control for which URLs trace propagation should be enabled tracePropagationTargets: ["localhost", /^https:\/\/yourserver\.io\/api/], }); You can establish a uniform sample rate for all transactions by setting the tracesSampleRate option in your SDK config to a number between 0 and 1. (For example, to send 20% of transactions, set tracesSampleRate to 0.2.)For more granular control over sampling, you can set the sample rate based on the transaction itself and the context in which it's captured, by providing a function to the tracesSampler config option.The two options are mutually exclusive. If both are set, tracesSampler will take precedence.You can find more in-depth explanations and examples about sampling configuration in Configure Sampling.Distributed TracingSentry captures distributed traces consisting of transactions and spans, which measure individual services and individual operations within those services, respectively. Learn more about our model in Distributed Tracing.VerifyVerify that tracing is working correctly by using our automatic instrumentation or by starting and finishing a transaction using custom instrumentation.While you're testing, set tracesSampleRate to 1.0, as that ensures that every transaction will be sent to Sentry. Once testing is complete, you may want to set a lower tracesSampleRate value, or switch to using tracesSampler to selectively sample and filter your transactions, based on contextual data.If you leave your sample rate at 1.0, a transaction will be sent every time a user loads a page or navigates within your app. Depending on the amount of traffic your application gets, this may mean a lot of transactions. If you have a high-load, backend application, you may want to consider setting a lower tracesSampleRate value, or switching to using tracesSampler to selectively sample and filter your transactions, based on contextual data.Automatic InstrumentationSee Automatic Instrumentation to learn about all the things that the SDK automatically instruments for you.Custom InstrumentationYou can also manually start spans to instrument specific parts of your code. This is useful when you want to measure the performance of a specific operation or function.Tracing APIs: Find information about APIs for custom tracing instrumentationInstrumentation: Find information about manual instrumentation with the Sentry SDKSending Span Metrics: Learn how to capture metrics on your spansDisabling TracingIf you want to disable tracing, you should not set tracesSampleRate at all. Setting it to 0 will not disable tracing, it will simply never send any traces to Sentry. Instead, neither tracesSampleRate nor tracesSampler should be defined in your SDK config to fully disable tracing.Next StepsSending Span MetricsLearn how to add attributes to spans to monitor performance and debug applications Set Up Distributed TracingLearn how to connect events across applications/services.Configure SamplingLearn how to configure sampling in your app.InstrumentationLearn how to configure spans to capture trace data on any action in your app.TroubleshootingLearn how to troubleshoot your tracing setup.PreviousData ManagementNextSending Span MetricsWas this helpful?Yes 👍No 👎How can we improve this page?Submit feedbackHelp improve this contentOur documentation is open source and available on GitHub.
