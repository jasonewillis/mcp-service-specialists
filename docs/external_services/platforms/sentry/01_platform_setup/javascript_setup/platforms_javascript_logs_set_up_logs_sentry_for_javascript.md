# Set Up Logs | Sentry for JavaScript

HomePlatformsJavaScriptLogs Copy pageSet Up LogsStructured logs allow you to send, view and query logs sent from your applications within Sentry.Now in BetaSentry Logs is currently in Beta. Features are still in-progress and may have bugs. We recognize the irony. For any questions or feedback, you can reach us on Discord or GitHub.With Sentry Structured Logs, you can send text-based log information from your applications to Sentry. Once in Sentry, these logs can be viewed alongside relevant errors, searched by text-string, or searched using their individual attributes.RequirementsLogs for JavaScript are supported in Sentry JavaScript SDK version 9.41.0 and above.Logging is not supported in the loader or CDN script for browser JavaScript. We recommend installing the SDK via NPM to use logging. We are tracking support for the loader and CDN script in this GitHub issue.SetupTo enable logging, you need to initialize the SDK with the enableLogs option set to true.JsCopiedSentry.init({ dsn: "https://examplePublicKey@o0.ingest.sentry.io/0", // Enable logs to be sent to Sentry enableLogs: true, }); UsageOnce the feature is enabled on the SDK and the SDK is initialized, you can send logs using the Sentry.logger APIs.The Sentry.logger namespace exposes six methods that you can use to log messages at different log levels: trace, debug, info, warn, error, and fatal.Aside from the primary logging methods, we've provided a format text function, Sentry.logger.fmt, that you can use to insert properties into to your log entries.These properties will be sent to Sentry, and can be searched from within the Logs UI, and even added to the Logs views as a dedicated column.JsCopiedconst { logger } = Sentry; logger.error(logger.fmt`Uh on, something broke, here's the error: '${error}'`); logger.info(logger.fmt`'${user.username}' added '${product.name}' to cart.`); You can also pass additional attributes directly to the logging functions, avoiding the need to use the fmt function.JsCopiedconst { logger } = Sentry; logger.trace("Starting database connection", { database: "users" }); logger.debug("Cache miss for user", { userId: 123 }); logger.info("Updated profile", { profileId: 345 }); logger.warn("Rate limit reached for endpoint", { endpoint: "/api/results/", isEnterprise: false, }); logger.error("Failed to process payment", { orderId: "order_123", amount: 99.99, }); logger.fatal("Database connection pool exhausted", { database: "users", activeConnections: 100, }); IntegrationsConsole Logging IntegrationYou can also configure the SDK to send logs via the JavaScript console object, using the SDK's consoleLoggingIntegration.JsCopiedSentry.init({ dsn: "https://examplePublicKey@o0.ingest.sentry.io/0", integrations: [ // send console.log, console.warn, and console.error calls as logs to Sentry Sentry.consoleLoggingIntegration({ levels: ["log", "warn", "error"] }), ], }); The consoleLoggingIntegration accepts a levels option, which is an array of console method names to log. By default the integration will log calls from console.debug, console.info, console.warn, console.error, console.log, console.assert, and console.trace.OptionsbeforeSendLogTo filter logs, or update them before they are sent to Sentry, you can use the beforeSendLog option.JsCopiedSentry.init({ dsn: "https://examplePublicKey@o0.ingest.sentry.io/0", enableLogs: true, beforeSendLog: (log) => { if (log.level === "info") { // Filter out all info logs return null; } return log; }, }); The beforeSendLog function receives a log object, and should return the log object if you want it to be sent to Sentry, or null if you want to discard it.The log object has the following properties:level: (string - one of trace, debug, info, warn, error, fatal) The log level.message: (string) The message to be logged.timestamp: (number) The timestamp of the log.attributes: (object) The attributes of the log.PreviousSet Up Session ReplayNextSet Up User FeedbackWas this helpful?Yes üëçNo üëéHow can we improve this page?Submit feedbackHelp improve this contentOur documentation is open source and available on GitHub.
