# Python | Sentry for Python

HomePlatformsPython Copy pagePythonSentry's Python SDK enables automatic reporting of errors and performance data in your application.PrerequisitesYou need a Sentry account and projectRead one of our dedicated guides if you use any of the frameworks we supportFeaturesSelect which Sentry features you'd like to install in addition to Error Monitoring to get the corresponding installation and configuration instructions below.Error MonitoringLogsTracingProfilingInstallInstall the Sentry SDK using pip:pipuvCopiedpip install "sentry-sdk" ConfigureConfiguration should happen as early as possible in your application's lifecycle.PythonCopiedimport sentry_sdk sentry_sdk.init( dsn="https://examplePublicKey@o0.ingest.sentry.io/0", # Add request headers and IP for users, # see https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/python/data-management/data-collected/ for more info send_default_pii=True, # performance # Set traces_sample_rate to 1.0 to capture 100% # of transactions for tracing. traces_sample_rate=1.0, # performance # profiling # To collect profiles for all profile sessions, # set `profile_session_sample_rate` to 1.0. profile_session_sample_rate=1.0, # Profiles will be automatically collected while # there is an active span. profile_lifecycle="trace", # profiling # logs # Enable logs to be sent to Sentry enable_logs=True, # logs ) However, in async applications, you need to call sentry_sdk.init() inside an async function to ensure async code is instrumented properly. We recommend calling sentry_sdk.init() at the beginning of the first async function you call, as demonstrated in the example below.PythonCopiedimport asyncio import sentry_sdk async def main(): sentry_sdk.init( ... # same as above ) asyncio.run(main()) VerifyAdd this intentional error to your application to test that everything is working right away.PyCopieddivision_by_zero = 1 / 0 Learn more about manually capturing an error or message in our Usage documentation.To view and resolve the recorded error, log into sentry.io and select your project. Clicking on the error's title will open a page where you can see detailed information and mark it as resolved.Not seeing your error in Sentry? Make sure you're running the above example from a file and not from a Python shell like IPython.PreviousWelcome to SentryNextConfigurationWas this helpful?Yes üëçNo üëéHow can we improve this page?Submit feedbackHelp improve this contentOur documentation is open source and available on GitHub.
