# Set Up User Feedback | Sentry for Python

HomePlatformsPythonUser Feedback Copy pageSet Up User FeedbackLearn more about collecting user feedback when an event occurs. Sentry pairs the feedback with the original event, giving you additional insight into issues.When a user experiences an error, Sentry provides the ability to collect additional feedback. You can collect feedback according to the method supported by the SDK.Crash-Report ModalOur embeddable, JavaScript-based, Crash-Report modal is useful when you would typically render a plain error page (the classic 500.html) on your website.To collect feedback, the Crash-Report modal requests and collects the user's name, email address, and a description of what occurred. When feedback is provided, Sentry pairs the feedback with the original event, giving you additional insights into issues.The screenshot below provides an example of the Crash-Report modal, though yours may differ depending on your customization:IntegrationThe modal authenticates with your public DSN, then passes in the Event ID that was generated on your backend.Retrieve the last_event_id on your server and pass it to the HTML template to use during template rendering (this example uses Flask but the principle is the same on every framework):PythonCopiedimport sentry_sdk from flask import render_template @app.errorhandler(500) def server_error_handler(error): event_id=sentry_sdk.last_event_id() return render_template("500.html", sentry_event_id=event_id), 500 Make sure you've got the JavaScript SDK available:HTMLCopied<script src="https://browser.sentry-cdn.com/10.5.0/bundle.min.js" integrity="sha384-SAsRvjfAFRX3iwi3MG6ToeZNJVpHcRXKcITfFVLQipWK3uQ8SakuVmHDoSR3YNmJ" crossorigin="anonymous" ></script> And the code that brings up the dialog in your template:HTMLCopied{% if sentry_event_id %} <script> Sentry.init({ dsn: "https://examplePublicKey@o0.ingest.sentry.io/0" }); Sentry.showReportDialog({ eventId: "{{ sentry_event_id }}" }); </script> {% endif %} PreviousSet Up LogsNextConfigurationWas this helpful?Yes üëçNo üëéHow can we improve this page?Submit feedbackHelp improve this contentOur documentation is open source and available on GitHub.
