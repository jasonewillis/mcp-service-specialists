HomeProduct WalkthroughsIssuesIssue Views Copy pageIssue ViewsLearn how to create, customize, and share your Issues experience in Sentry.Issue views let you customize and share your issue stream, so you and your teammates can quickly see the issues that are most relevant to you.Creating Your First ViewTo create your first custom issue view, navigate to the All Views page and click the + Create View button on the top right.This will create a new starred view, which you can than update with the filters of your choosing. Some common use cases for views include:Prioritized: A view containing only issues with high or medium priorityAssigned to Me: A view for issues assigned to yourself and your teamsFor Review: A view for issues that have been assigned to you or your teams to reviewRequest Errors: A view for issues with requests that returned a 500 status codeHigh Volume Errors: A view for issues that have occurred a large number of timesRecent Errors: A view containing issues that have appeared in the last dayFunction regressions: A view containing performance issues for functions that have regressed in latencyCustomizing Your ViewsUpdating ViewsViews are defined by their search query, sort, and project/environment/time range filters. Changing any of these parameters won't automatically persist those changes to your view, however. If your current filters have diverged from the view's original filters, a purple dot will appear next to your view in the navigation, and hovering over it will show which filters have been changed:To persist these changes to your view, simply click on the purple Save button to the right of the search and sort inputs in the Issues page. You may also create a new view with these changes by clicking Save as new view, or you can reset the view back to its original filters by clicking Reset.Reordering ViewsYou can reorder the starred views in the navigation by hovering over them and clicking and dragging the handle to the desirable position.Renaming ViewsTo rename a view, navigate to that view's page and hover over the page header, which will reveal a pencil icon. Click the pencil icon to edit the view's name.You can also do this by navigating to the All Views page and clicking on the view's ellipsis menu and selecting Rename.Sharing ViewsBrowsing and Starring Your Organization's ViewsAll Issue Views are visible to all members of your organization, and you can browse your organization's views by navigating to the All Views page.
