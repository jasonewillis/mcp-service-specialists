# ⚠️ CRITICAL: OPM Salary Calculation

## Formula for Total Salary
```
Total Salary = Base Pay × (1 + Locality Adjustment)
```

## Example Calculation
GS-13 Step 5 in Washington DC:
- Base Pay: $96,357
- Locality Adjustment: 32.49%
- Total: $96,357 × 1.3249 = $127,675

## Within-Grade Increases (WGI)
- Steps 1-3: Every year
- Steps 4-6: Every 2 years
- Steps 7-9: Every 3 years

## Special Rate Tables
Some positions (IT, Medical) have special rates above GS base

## Key Points
- 10 steps within each grade
- 15 GS grades total
- 53 official locality areas
- Rest of US gets 16.50% adjustment
